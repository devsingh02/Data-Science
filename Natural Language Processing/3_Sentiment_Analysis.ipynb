        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

The tragedy leaves Brian physically wounded and emotionally shattered, his vocal cords damaged to the point of near-silence. Consumed by grief and rage, Brian embarks on a brutal quest for revenge against the gang responsible, transforming himself into a silent vigilante fueled by his pain.\\nThrough a combination of intense training and self-taught combat skills, Brian becomes a formidable force, navigating the underbelly of the city with a silent fury. The film\\u2019s minimalist dialogue emphasizes the visual storytelling, showcasing John Woo\\u2019s signature balletic gunfights and action sequences, often infused with his trademark doves and slow-motion cinematography.\\nAs Brian hunts down his targets, one by one, he clashes with the charismatic and ruthless gang leader, Playa (played by Harold Torres). Their confrontation forms the film\\u2019s climax, a violent ballet of vengeance set against the backdrop of a snowy Christmas Eve. Silent Night explores themes of loss, grief, and the seductive nature of revenge. It\\u2019s a raw and emotional journey, punctuated by moments of breathtaking action and John Woo\\u2019s signature visual flair. * * * * * * (MUSIC BOX PLAYING GENTLE MELODY) (SIREN BLARING) (MUSIC BOX STOPS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (BELL JINGLING) (GODLOCK PANTING) (BELL JINGLING) (SIRENS BLARING) (TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GUNFIRE) (SIRENS WAILING) (GUN FIRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR ENGINES SPEEDING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER) (GODLOCK GRUNTS, PANTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (PANTING) (TRAIN HORN BLARING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SIRENS WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (ENGINES REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GUNS FIRING) (MAN GROANS) (GROANING) (CAR HONKING HORN) (MAN GROANS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (LOUD CRASHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (HONKING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK PANTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) (MEN LAUGHING) (ENGINE REVVING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MEN YELPING) (CAR CRASHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING, PANTING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (FORKLIFT BEEPING) (GUN FIRING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MAN YELLS) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GUNSHOT) (GODLOCK GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) (GODLOCK GURGLES, CHOKES) MALE SINGER: \\u266a Silent night \\u266a Holy night (SAYA PANTING) \\u266a All is calm \\u266a All is bright \\u266a Round yon Virgin Mother and Child \\u266a Holy infant \\u266a So tender and mild \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (SAYA CRIES, WHIMPERS) \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (MACHINE BEEPING) CHOIR: (SINGING) \\u266a Silent night (DOCTOR AND NURSE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) \\u266a Holy night \\u266a Shepherds quake \\u266a At the sight \\u266a Glories stream (SAYA WHIMPERS) \\u266a From afar \\u266a (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) DOCTOR: Suction.

Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, H.E.R., Halle Bailey, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi\\nRelease dates: November 20, 2023 (London), December\\u00a025,\\u00a02023\\u00a0(United States)\\nRunning time: 141 minutes The 2023 film adaptation of The Color Purple offers a profound exploration of Alice Walker\\u2018s renowned novel, presenting a vivid portrayal of endurance, sisterhood, and self-realization set against a backdrop of deep-seated racism and sexism. This adaptation enriches the narrative with its emotional depth and complexity. Act I: The Emergence of Adversity and Hope: In rural Georgia of the early 1900s, we are introduced to Celie (Danielle Brooks), a young Black woman enduring severe mistreatment at the hands of her father, Alfonso (Louis Gossett Jr.). Her life is a series of tragedies, marked by the loss of her two children and an enforced marriage to the callous widower Albert \\u201cMister\\u201d Johnson (Colman Domingo). Her only comfort comes through secret letters to her sister Nettie (H.E.R.), who escapes their father\\u2019s tyranny to join missionaries in Africa. These letters become Celie\\u2019s outlet, a means to articulate her anguish and yearn for a brighter existence. Celie\\u2019s life takes a turn with the arrival of Shug Avery (Taraji P. Henson), a bold singer and Mister\\u2019s lover. Enthralled by Shug\\u2019s freedom and charm, Celie forms a deep connection with her, learning about love and reclaiming her self-esteem. Shug\\u2019s influence empowers Celie to confront the abuse she faces from Mister. Act II: The Growth of Sisterhood and Rebellion: Despite societal judgment and jealousy, Celie\\u2019s bond with Shug flourishes, igniting a sense of defiance in her. She allies with Sofia (Halle Bailey), Mister\\u2019s assertive daughter-in-law, and Squeak (Ciara), Sofia\\u2019s partner, who also suffers Mister\\u2019s scorn. Together, these women create a haven of mutual support, finding comfort in music and stories, and resist the suppression imposed upon them. Sofia\\u2019s bold stance against Mister leads to her imprisonment, a pivotal moment that strengthens Celie\\u2019s resolve to liberate herself. She embarks on a journey of self-education, discovering her voice through poetry and music. Act III: The Path to Self-Discovery and Healing: As time passes and societal change swirls around her, Celie experiences transformative moments. Nettie\\u2019s return brings revelations about their family and\\noffers closure to Celie\\u2019s long-held sorrows. Simultaneously, Mister experiences a personal evolution, recognizing the resilience and fortitude of the women he\\u2019s wronged, and seeks to make amends. Celie, now embracing her newfound strength and autonomy, establishes a juke joint, a lively haven for women to celebrate their identities and express themselves without restraint. She openly accepts her sexuality and revels in life\\u2019s myriad possibilities. The 2023 adaptation of The Color Purple transcends a straightforward plot, weaving a rich, layered narrative that reflects both personal and collective transformation. It highlights the resilience of women and the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood, prevailing against overwhelming odds. * * * * * * [banjo playing] [horse hooves clopping] [clapping] [sister 1] \\u266a Hey, sister Whatcha gon\\u2019 do? \\u266a [sister 2] \\u266a Going down by the river Gonna play with you \\u266a \\u266a Papa don\\u2019t like No screaming round here \\u266a \\u266a No lip from a woman When they chug that beer \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff sun gon\\u2019 shine \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be grown ladies Of the marrying kind \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff moon gon\\u2019 rise \\u266a \\u266a Like a huckleberry pie In the middle of the sky \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be all right Gonna be all right \\u266a [both chuckling] [sister 1 sighs] [sister 1] Nettie.

Whew, would you look at all of God\\u2019s beautiful creation. You know, God loves admiration. Mmm. You saying God is vain. No. Not vain, Miss Celie. God just wants to share a good thing.

[band members chattering] Hey. Take me with you. Next time. I\\u2019ll be back before you can spell Mississippi. Come on, fellas. [exhales sharply] [breathing heavily] [Nettie] Dear Celie, when Mister forced me off his land, I got a job working for a pastor across town. I help take care of their babies for food and shelter. They told me they were going to Africa as missionaries. While we were on a great boat to Africa, the reverend told me he and his wife couldn\\u2019t bear chil\\u2019ren. But God sent them two. They showed me the name you had sewn on the baby\\u2019s blanket, and I knew the babies were yours. It\\u2019s a miracle! Adam and Olivia are right here with me. My babies. They alive. And they with Nettie. [Asante tribespeople singing] [rhythmic music playing] [Nettie] It was like Black seeing Black for the first time. Celie, we are more than just kings and queens. We\\u2019re at the center of the universe. Dear Celie, I hope this letter finds you well. [British soldiers shouting] Life has become dire for us. Our village was bombed in order to make way for a road to grow cocoa trees. [British colonial soldiers shouting] [Asante tribespeople screaming] [Nettie] The British colonial administrators ignored our pleas to let us keep our land. We couldn\\u2019t fight \\u2019em, so now we walk to a refugee camp across the border. I have faith that God will let us see each other before we die. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to recognize each other. Celie! Why supper late? [inhales sharply] Because I I lost track of time I works the land from sunup to sundown, breaking my back. All you gots to do is cook and clean, and you can\\u2019t even do that. [Celie breathing heavily] I\\u2013 I\\u2019ll do better. That\\u2019s what ya mouth say. [gasps] Clean it up! If I gots to eat late, you won\\u2019t eat at all. [sighs] [Sofia] There we go.

And we thank you for his daughter Celie, who we welcome back home. And likewise, we thanks you for his wife, dear sister Mary Ellen, who we are praying for in her hour of bereavement. Mr. Alfonso was a man. A hardworking man. Now, sure, he was difficult and, uh, stubborn. Now you\\u2019re preaching. [person in church shushes] And I\\u2019d be a liar if I told you for certain that Mr. Alfonso made it to the pearly gates. [congregation] Mmhmm. [Sofia chuckles] [reverend] What I do know is we must forgive, and ask forgiveness from others, or God will be hardpressed to show his mercy toward us. [congregation murmurs] [reverend] So don\\u2019t tarry, church. For no one knows what day, what hour, we will see our Father again. Amen? Amen. [congregation] Amen. Ezekiel, if you will.

We wasn\\u2019t quite on speaking terms. Well, when I went to settle Alfonso\\u2019s will, I found out from the lawyer that this wasn\\u2019t his land nor his store. Your real pa built this place. Alfonso\\u2026 was my pa. No, ma\\u2019am. When your daddy died, your ma married Alfonso. After she died, Alfonso took over the store. Your real daddy even put you and your sister\\u2019s name on the deed. That\\u2019s how I know this here land belongs to y\\u2019all. I had a ma\\u2026 and a pa that loved me.

The tragedy leaves Brian physically wounded and emotionally shattered, his vocal cords damaged to the point of near-silence. Consumed by grief and rage, Brian embarks on a brutal quest for revenge against the gang responsible, transforming himself into a silent vigilante fueled by his pain.\\nThrough a combination of intense training and self-taught combat skills, Brian becomes a formidable force, navigating the underbelly of the city with a silent fury. The film\\u2019s minimalist dialogue emphasizes the visual storytelling, showcasing John Woo\\u2019s signature balletic gunfights and action sequences, often infused with his trademark doves and slow-motion cinematography.\\nAs Brian hunts down his targets, one by one, he clashes with the charismatic and ruthless gang leader, Playa (played by Harold Torres). Their confrontation forms the film\\u2019s climax, a violent ballet of vengeance set against the backdrop of a snowy Christmas Eve. Silent Night explores themes of loss, grief, and the seductive nature of revenge. It\\u2019s a raw and emotional journey, punctuated by moments of breathtaking action and John Woo\\u2019s signature visual flair. * * * * * * (MUSIC BOX PLAYING GENTLE MELODY) (SIREN BLARING) (MUSIC BOX STOPS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (BELL JINGLING) (GODLOCK PANTING) (BELL JINGLING) (SIRENS BLARING) (TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GUNFIRE) (SIRENS WAILING) (GUN FIRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR ENGINES SPEEDING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER) (GODLOCK GRUNTS, PANTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (PANTING) (TRAIN HORN BLARING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SIRENS WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (ENGINES REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GUNS FIRING) (MAN GROANS) (GROANING) (CAR HONKING HORN) (MAN GROANS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (LOUD CRASHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (HONKING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK PANTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) (MEN LAUGHING) (ENGINE REVVING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MEN YELPING) (CAR CRASHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING, PANTING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (FORKLIFT BEEPING) (GUN FIRING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MAN YELLS) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GUNSHOT) (GODLOCK GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) (GODLOCK GURGLES, CHOKES) MALE SINGER: \\u266a Silent night \\u266a Holy night (SAYA PANTING) \\u266a All is calm \\u266a All is bright \\u266a Round yon Virgin Mother and Child \\u266a Holy infant \\u266a So tender and mild \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (SAYA CRIES, WHIMPERS) \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (MACHINE BEEPING) CHOIR: (SINGING) \\u266a Silent night (DOCTOR AND NURSE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) \\u266a Holy night \\u266a Shepherds quake \\u266a At the sight \\u266a Glories stream (SAYA WHIMPERS) \\u266a From afar \\u266a (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) DOCTOR: Suction.

Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, H.E.R., Halle Bailey, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi\\nRelease dates: November 20, 2023 (London), December\\u00a025,\\u00a02023\\u00a0(United States)\\nRunning time: 141 minutes The 2023 film adaptation of The Color Purple offers a profound exploration of Alice Walker\\u2018s renowned novel, presenting a vivid portrayal of endurance, sisterhood, and self-realization set against a backdrop of deep-seated racism and sexism. This adaptation enriches the narrative with its emotional depth and complexity. Act I: The Emergence of Adversity and Hope: In rural Georgia of the early 1900s, we are introduced to Celie (Danielle Brooks), a young Black woman enduring severe mistreatment at the hands of her father, Alfonso (Louis Gossett Jr.). Her life is a series of tragedies, marked by the loss of her two children and an enforced marriage to the callous widower Albert \\u201cMister\\u201d Johnson (Colman Domingo). Her only comfort comes through secret letters to her sister Nettie (H.E.R.), who escapes their father\\u2019s tyranny to join missionaries in Africa. These letters become Celie\\u2019s outlet, a means to articulate her anguish and yearn for a brighter existence. Celie\\u2019s life takes a turn with the arrival of Shug Avery (Taraji P. Henson), a bold singer and Mister\\u2019s lover. Enthralled by Shug\\u2019s freedom and charm, Celie forms a deep connection with her, learning about love and reclaiming her self-esteem. Shug\\u2019s influence empowers Celie to confront the abuse she faces from Mister. Act II: The Growth of Sisterhood and Rebellion: Despite societal judgment and jealousy, Celie\\u2019s bond with Shug flourishes, igniting a sense of defiance in her. She allies with Sofia (Halle Bailey), Mister\\u2019s assertive daughter-in-law, and Squeak (Ciara), Sofia\\u2019s partner, who also suffers Mister\\u2019s scorn. Together, these women create a haven of mutual support, finding comfort in music and stories, and resist the suppression imposed upon them. Sofia\\u2019s bold stance against Mister leads to her imprisonment, a pivotal moment that strengthens Celie\\u2019s resolve to liberate herself. She embarks on a journey of self-education, discovering her voice through poetry and music. Act III: The Path to Self-Discovery and Healing: As time passes and societal change swirls around her, Celie experiences transformative moments. Nettie\\u2019s return brings revelations about their family and\\noffers closure to Celie\\u2019s long-held sorrows. Simultaneously, Mister experiences a personal evolution, recognizing the resilience and fortitude of the women he\\u2019s wronged, and seeks to make amends. Celie, now embracing her newfound strength and autonomy, establishes a juke joint, a lively haven for women to celebrate their identities and express themselves without restraint. She openly accepts her sexuality and revels in life\\u2019s myriad possibilities. The 2023 adaptation of The Color Purple transcends a straightforward plot, weaving a rich, layered narrative that reflects both personal and collective transformation. It highlights the resilience of women and the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood, prevailing against overwhelming odds. * * * * * * [banjo playing] [horse hooves clopping] [clapping] [sister 1] \\u266a Hey, sister Whatcha gon\\u2019 do? \\u266a [sister 2] \\u266a Going down by the river Gonna play with you \\u266a \\u266a Papa don\\u2019t like No screaming round here \\u266a \\u266a No lip from a woman When they chug that beer \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff sun gon\\u2019 shine \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be grown ladies Of the marrying kind \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff moon gon\\u2019 rise \\u266a \\u266a Like a huckleberry pie In the middle of the sky \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be all right Gonna be all right \\u266a [both chuckling] [sister 1 sighs] [sister 1] Nettie.

Whew, would you look at all of God\\u2019s beautiful creation. You know, God loves admiration. Mmm. You saying God is vain. No. Not vain, Miss Celie. God just wants to share a good thing.

[band members chattering] Hey. Take me with you. Next time. I\\u2019ll be back before you can spell Mississippi. Come on, fellas. [exhales sharply] [breathing heavily] [Nettie] Dear Celie, when Mister forced me off his land, I got a job working for a pastor across town. I help take care of their babies for food and shelter. They told me they were going to Africa as missionaries. While we were on a great boat to Africa, the reverend told me he and his wife couldn\\u2019t bear chil\\u2019ren. But God sent them two. They showed me the name you had sewn on the baby\\u2019s blanket, and I knew the babies were yours. It\\u2019s a miracle! Adam and Olivia are right here with me. My babies. They alive. And they with Nettie. [Asante tribespeople singing] [rhythmic music playing] [Nettie] It was like Black seeing Black for the first time. Celie, we are more than just kings and queens. We\\u2019re at the center of the universe. Dear Celie, I hope this letter finds you well. [British soldiers shouting] Life has become dire for us. Our village was bombed in order to make way for a road to grow cocoa trees. [British colonial soldiers shouting] [Asante tribespeople screaming] [Nettie] The British colonial administrators ignored our pleas to let us keep our land. We couldn\\u2019t fight \\u2019em, so now we walk to a refugee camp across the border. I have faith that God will let us see each other before we die. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to recognize each other. Celie! Why supper late? [inhales sharply] Because I I lost track of time I works the land from sunup to sundown, breaking my back. All you gots to do is cook and clean, and you can\\u2019t even do that. [Celie breathing heavily] I\\u2013 I\\u2019ll do better. That\\u2019s what ya mouth say. [gasps] Clean it up! If I gots to eat late, you won\\u2019t eat at all. [sighs] [Sofia] There we go.

And we thank you for his daughter Celie, who we welcome back home. And likewise, we thanks you for his wife, dear sister Mary Ellen, who we are praying for in her hour of bereavement. Mr. Alfonso was a man. A hardworking man. Now, sure, he was difficult and, uh, stubborn. Now you\\u2019re preaching. [person in church shushes] And I\\u2019d be a liar if I told you for certain that Mr. Alfonso made it to the pearly gates. [congregation] Mmhmm. [Sofia chuckles] [reverend] What I do know is we must forgive, and ask forgiveness from others, or God will be hardpressed to show his mercy toward us. [congregation murmurs] [reverend] So don\\u2019t tarry, church. For no one knows what day, what hour, we will see our Father again. Amen? Amen. [congregation] Amen. Ezekiel, if you will.

We wasn\\u2019t quite on speaking terms. Well, when I went to settle Alfonso\\u2019s will, I found out from the lawyer that this wasn\\u2019t his land nor his store. Your real pa built this place. Alfonso\\u2026 was my pa. No, ma\\u2019am. When your daddy died, your ma married Alfonso. After she died, Alfonso took over the store. Your real daddy even put you and your sister\\u2019s name on the deed. That\\u2019s how I know this here land belongs to y\\u2019all. I had a ma\\u2026 and a pa that loved me.

The tragedy leaves Brian physically wounded and emotionally shattered, his vocal cords damaged to the point of near-silence. Consumed by grief and rage, Brian embarks on a brutal quest for revenge against the gang responsible, transforming himself into a silent vigilante fueled by his pain.\\nThrough a combination of intense training and self-taught combat skills, Brian becomes a formidable force, navigating the underbelly of the city with a silent fury. The film\\u2019s minimalist dialogue emphasizes the visual storytelling, showcasing John Woo\\u2019s signature balletic gunfights and action sequences, often infused with his trademark doves and slow-motion cinematography.\\nAs Brian hunts down his targets, one by one, he clashes with the charismatic and ruthless gang leader, Playa (played by Harold Torres). Their confrontation forms the film\\u2019s climax, a violent ballet of vengeance set against the backdrop of a snowy Christmas Eve. Silent Night explores themes of loss, grief, and the seductive nature of revenge. It\\u2019s a raw and emotional journey, punctuated by moments of breathtaking action and John Woo\\u2019s signature visual flair. * * * * * * (MUSIC BOX PLAYING GENTLE MELODY) (SIREN BLARING) (MUSIC BOX STOPS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (BELL JINGLING) (GODLOCK PANTING) (BELL JINGLING) (SIRENS BLARING) (TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GUNFIRE) (SIRENS WAILING) (GUN FIRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR ENGINES SPEEDING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER) (GODLOCK GRUNTS, PANTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (PANTING) (TRAIN HORN BLARING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SIRENS WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (ENGINES REVVING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GUNS FIRING) (MAN GROANS) (GROANING) (CAR HONKING HORN) (MAN GROANS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (LOUD CRASHING) (CAR HORN HONKING) (HONKING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK PANTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) (MEN LAUGHING) (ENGINE REVVING) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MEN YELPING) (CAR CRASHING) (GUNS FIRING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GODLOCK GRUNTING, PANTING) (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (FORKLIFT BEEPING) (GUN FIRING) (BEEPING CONTINUES) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (MAN YELLS) (GODLOCK GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GUNSHOT) (GODLOCK GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING) (BLOOD SQUELCHING) (GODLOCK GURGLES, CHOKES) MALE SINGER: \\u266a Silent night \\u266a Holy night (SAYA PANTING) \\u266a All is calm \\u266a All is bright \\u266a Round yon Virgin Mother and Child \\u266a Holy infant \\u266a So tender and mild \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (SAYA CRIES, WHIMPERS) \\u266a Sleep in heavenly peace (MACHINE BEEPING) CHOIR: (SINGING) \\u266a Silent night (DOCTOR AND NURSE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) \\u266a Holy night \\u266a Shepherds quake \\u266a At the sight \\u266a Glories stream (SAYA WHIMPERS) \\u266a From afar \\u266a (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) DOCTOR: Suction.

Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, H.E.R., Halle Bailey, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi\\nRelease dates: November 20, 2023 (London), December\\u00a025,\\u00a02023\\u00a0(United States)\\nRunning time: 141 minutes The 2023 film adaptation of The Color Purple offers a profound exploration of Alice Walker\\u2018s renowned novel, presenting a vivid portrayal of endurance, sisterhood, and self-realization set against a backdrop of deep-seated racism and sexism. This adaptation enriches the narrative with its emotional depth and complexity. Act I: The Emergence of Adversity and Hope: In rural Georgia of the early 1900s, we are introduced to Celie (Danielle Brooks), a young Black woman enduring severe mistreatment at the hands of her father, Alfonso (Louis Gossett Jr.). Her life is a series of tragedies, marked by the loss of her two children and an enforced marriage to the callous widower Albert \\u201cMister\\u201d Johnson (Colman Domingo). Her only comfort comes through secret letters to her sister Nettie (H.E.R.), who escapes their father\\u2019s tyranny to join missionaries in Africa. These letters become Celie\\u2019s outlet, a means to articulate her anguish and yearn for a brighter existence. Celie\\u2019s life takes a turn with the arrival of Shug Avery (Taraji P. Henson), a bold singer and Mister\\u2019s lover. Enthralled by Shug\\u2019s freedom and charm, Celie forms a deep connection with her, learning about love and reclaiming her self-esteem. Shug\\u2019s influence empowers Celie to confront the abuse she faces from Mister. Act II: The Growth of Sisterhood and Rebellion: Despite societal judgment and jealousy, Celie\\u2019s bond with Shug flourishes, igniting a sense of defiance in her. She allies with Sofia (Halle Bailey), Mister\\u2019s assertive daughter-in-law, and Squeak (Ciara), Sofia\\u2019s partner, who also suffers Mister\\u2019s scorn. Together, these women create a haven of mutual support, finding comfort in music and stories, and resist the suppression imposed upon them. Sofia\\u2019s bold stance against Mister leads to her imprisonment, a pivotal moment that strengthens Celie\\u2019s resolve to liberate herself. She embarks on a journey of self-education, discovering her voice through poetry and music. Act III: The Path to Self-Discovery and Healing: As time passes and societal change swirls around her, Celie experiences transformative moments. Nettie\\u2019s return brings revelations about their family and\\noffers closure to Celie\\u2019s long-held sorrows. Simultaneously, Mister experiences a personal evolution, recognizing the resilience and fortitude of the women he\\u2019s wronged, and seeks to make amends. Celie, now embracing her newfound strength and autonomy, establishes a juke joint, a lively haven for women to celebrate their identities and express themselves without restraint. She openly accepts her sexuality and revels in life\\u2019s myriad possibilities. The 2023 adaptation of The Color Purple transcends a straightforward plot, weaving a rich, layered narrative that reflects both personal and collective transformation. It highlights the resilience of women and the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood, prevailing against overwhelming odds. * * * * * * [banjo playing] [horse hooves clopping] [clapping] [sister 1] \\u266a Hey, sister Whatcha gon\\u2019 do? \\u266a [sister 2] \\u266a Going down by the river Gonna play with you \\u266a \\u266a Papa don\\u2019t like No screaming round here \\u266a \\u266a No lip from a woman When they chug that beer \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff sun gon\\u2019 shine \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be grown ladies Of the marrying kind \\u266a \\u266a Sho\\u2019 nuff moon gon\\u2019 rise \\u266a \\u266a Like a huckleberry pie In the middle of the sky \\u266a \\u266a Gonna be all right Gonna be all right \\u266a [both chuckling] [sister 1 sighs] [sister 1] Nettie.

[band members chattering] Hey. Take me with you. Next time. I\\u2019ll be back before you can spell Mississippi. Come on, fellas. [exhales sharply] [breathing heavily] [Nettie] Dear Celie, when Mister forced me off his land, I got a job working for a pastor across town. I help take care of their babies for food and shelter. They told me they were going to Africa as missionaries. While we were on a great boat to Africa, the reverend told me he and his wife couldn\\u2019t bear chil\\u2019ren. But God sent them two. They showed me the name you had sewn on the baby\\u2019s blanket, and I knew the babies were yours. It\\u2019s a miracle! Adam and Olivia are right here with me. My babies. They alive. And they with Nettie. [Asante tribespeople singing] [rhythmic music playing] [Nettie] It was like Black seeing Black for the first time. Celie, we are more than just kings and queens. We\\u2019re at the center of the universe. Dear Celie, I hope this letter finds you well. [British soldiers shouting] Life has become dire for us. Our village was bombed in order to make way for a road to grow cocoa trees. [British colonial soldiers shouting] [Asante tribespeople screaming] [Nettie] The British colonial administrators ignored our pleas to let us keep our land. We couldn\\u2019t fight \\u2019em, so now we walk to a refugee camp across the border. I have faith that God will let us see each other before we die. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to recognize each other. Celie! Why supper late? [inhales sharply] Because I I lost track of time I works the land from sunup to sundown, breaking my back. All you gots to do is cook and clean, and you can\\u2019t even do that. [Celie breathing heavily] I\\u2013 I\\u2019ll do better. That\\u2019s what ya mouth say. [gasps] Clean it up! If I gots to eat late, you won\\u2019t eat at all. [sighs] [Sofia] There we go.

[person in church shushes] And I\\u2019d be a liar if I told you for certain that Mr. Alfonso made it to the pearly gates. [congregation] Mmhmm. [Sofia chuckles] [reverend] What I do know is we must forgive, and ask forgiveness from others, or God will be hardpressed to show his mercy toward us. [congregation murmurs] [reverend] So don\\u2019t tarry, church. For no one knows what day, what hour, we will see our Father again. Amen? Amen. [congregation] Amen. Ezekiel, if you will. [piano playing] [Mary Ellen] God bless you. [First Lady] Good to see you. God bless you. [Mary Ellen] Bless you. Really enjoyed your sermon, Pa. Especially what you what you said about forgiveness and\\u2013 Ain\\u2019t the time right now. Reverend\\u2019s busy. God bless you, baby. God bless you. Good to see you. Good to see you. Meet me at the store. I got something to tell you. What\\u2019s this for? The place is yours. He didn\\u2019t leave it to you? No, ma\\u2019am. It wasn\\u2019t his to give. You didn\\u2019t know? We wasn\\u2019t quite on speaking terms. Well, when I went to settle Alfonso\\u2019s will, I found out from the lawyer that this wasn\\u2019t his land nor his store. Your real pa built this place. Alfonso\\u2026 was my pa. No, ma\\u2019am. When your daddy died, your ma married Alfonso. After she died, Alfonso took over the store. Your real daddy even put you and your sister\\u2019s name on the deed. That\\u2019s how I know this here land belongs to y\\u2019all. I had a ma\\u2026 and a pa that loved me. Dear God\\u2026 I hope this place brings you and your sister comfort.

[girl 2] My cousin said there’s a kid who smokes there. [male 2] You see anything? [male 1] No. A lot of yappin’. Come on. [male 2] Ah, there we go. All right. Another year, another batch of 5th grade head cases. Kabir, Anthony, welcome. You from New York, new guy? Patriots suck! That’s New England. I think your shirt’s on backwards. Come on! Look at this. Bunch of motormouths. Yep. Same old, same old. I saw Cara in a sweater from Gymboree. There’s the snotty clique. Tween Queens. The Facade Squad. Peaking at 11. The “sick and should’ve stayed home” kid. Always one. [turtle] There’s the class clown who secretly despises himself. That’s hysterical, Cole! Thanks, Cole! Jeez, how many Coles this year? Reminds me of the Justin avalanche of 1991. God forbid we ever see a Richie again. Bro, no way, are you taller than me now? The inevitable Cheez Doodle kid. [turtle] No, those look like Dorito fingers. We just moved from the Bronx. You’re new? Wow. That’s hard. Never had to leave friends, except when we went to Myrtle Beach. On the flight home, the old lady next to me had arthritis. I opened her mustard packet. [both] First child. No filter. Never heard the word “enough.” Okay, guys. Are you excited? Most of you have been going to this school for five years. Some of you, seven. And now you’re the big kids. I hope everyone’s met our class pets, Leonardo and Squirtle. I’m not touching those things. Don’t they eat, sleep and poo in the same place? Hey! I poo where he sleeps. Now what if I told you there’s a big reward at the end of this year if you do well in class? [kids gasp] The Academicathalon thing? Look at her work these kids. Salinas, what a pro. Best since Ms. Bielecky in the ’60s. And what if I told you this year’s winning class gets a field trip to somewhere special for a whole day? [kids cheer softly] [kid 1] Yeah! [kid 2] Wow! Salinas havin’ a baby? The belly’s poppin’ a little. Oh, Zane, I’m afraid you can’t bring snacks into the class. I’ll hold those, just for now. Cheetos. Wow, didn’t see that coming. [munching] At the end of the year, our three 5th grade classes compete in art, debating, science, and history. And if our class wins, we get a trip to Magic Land Park! [kids gasp] Don’t they have the Dragon Coaster? I heard it caught fire once! Yeah, it was banned in Europe. Yes, but not in Florida. [kids chatter and giggle] Yep, havin’ a baby. Okay. Let’s see how much you guys already know. Who knows what you call it when a plant… [munching] …converts light to food? The conversion’s photosynthesis… [both] Photosynthesis. [Mia] …turning H2O and CO2 into glucose. [both] Into glucose. Ah. [Mrs. Salinas] Excellent job, Mia. Oh. So… [clears throat] Oh, boy. Divorced parents. Okay, honey. Thank you. You’re okay. So sweet. [stick squeaking] Okay. Let’s look at some of the books we’re gonna read in class this year. Who’s heard of Charlotte’s Web? Oh no. The kids always cry at the end. Like kids don’t cry enough? We gotta trigger the garden hoses? Crying’s for weaklings. Right. We’ll meet Fern and her pig, Wilbur. It’s a stupid book anyway. Right. Animals never talk to people. Plus, no one gets to eat Charlotte. You just have to hear about this delicious spider for days and get hungry thinkin’ about it. …like you’ll learn this year. [boys laughing] Sorry, Cole? Is there something you wanna share? [laughing] [kids gasp, chatter] [kid 1] That’s so gross! [kid 2] I can’t believe you did that! [retching, vomiting] Sorry, guys. [sniffs] Man, that smells good. Send some of that our way next time. Gettin’ sick of the lettuce. [upbeat music playing] Hi, Mrs. Salinas! [indistinct chattering] Hi, I’m Cole Wiseki’s mom. Oh, hi. Can I… Real quick? For Facebook? Thanks. [shutter clicks] Cole is a very… That’s gonna look great. Thank you. Since when do people wanna look like ducks? [man] Isn’t that something, how they’ve grown? And in 5th grade, you’ll find your kids wanting to make their own choices. Embrace it. Let them make their own mistakes. How long does this go? [man] Not terribly long, Dr. Wenger. Now, some of you may have heard about Mrs. Salinas’, uh, incident in class. I want to confirm it has nothing to do with anything she ate in the cafeteria. She’s just gonna be taking some time off. A leave, let’s say. Wait. For how long? Here comes the bomb. For, uh… Till she has the baby, let’s say. [all gasp] What?! [Anthony’s mom] Having a baby? Are you sur',\n",
              "  'e? Did she get a second opinion? Are you kidding me? This is what happened in 3rd grade! The substitute was awful! I’m texting my daughter right now! She’ll be devastated! [phone beeps, chimes] [girl 1 reads silently] [girl 2 reads silently] [Mia reads silently] [girl 3 reads silently] [boy reads silently] [Anthony reads silently] [drone reads silently] [Cole H. reads silently] [Cole W. reads silently] [Kabir reads silently] [Summer reads silently] [Summer continues] [drone reads silently] [indistinct chattering] You can’t just say that! Look at these lazy class pets. Do they even move? I’d like that job. That lizard looks pretty old. Do I look old? Mm-mm. Thank you. It’s a Tuatara. They live a long time. Till about 75. Hmm. Never knew that. Suck on that, hamsters. Wow. Looks like he’s gettin’ close to that. [mom 1] Bye. Nice seeing you. Ah, he’s nuts. [door shuts]  I mean, you’re old, cranky, lazy, but no way does that make you 75. [Squirtle’s voice echoing] Seventy-five. Seventy-five. Seventy-five. [pencil tapping and scraping] [keyboard clacking] [page turning] [Neil Armstrong, on TV] Underneath it says, “Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon.” [grunts] [Neil Armstrong] We came in peace… [babbling] 1949. What about it? I was born around then. How many years has it been since 1949? No idea. That’s addition. They learn that in 2nd grade. We’re all about fractions. Great. Why can’t they move us around a little, so we can know more? [kindergartner babbles] [thuds, babbles again] [thuds, continues babbling] Okay, four sixteenths equals how many fourths? [kids chattering and laughing] She’s leaving. They don’t hear a word. 1966, 1967… What’re you doin’? Trying to count how many years old I am. 1968, 1969, 1970… I’m out of toes and fingers. What else can I count with? I’d tell you, but there’s kids around. [humorous music plays] I was talkin’ about his tail. Addition… I… I gotta talk to some 2nd grade pets. Forget it. We only see those pets at fire drills. They don’t happen until November. [alarm buzzing] [spits] What the… [all] Huh? What? Is this a fire drill? It’s probably nothing, but let’s go. Anthony, why don’t you grab the pets? [Anthony screaming] Everyone evacuate! Stop, drop and roll! [reptiles grunting] [screaming] I think I’m on fire! [screaming] [kindergartners giggling] Jeez, we just redecorated! Someday, cops are gonna carry that kid off a plane. Huh? I’ll park ya right over here, fellas. All right, here we go. Hey, guys, how was your summer? Do anything fun? Sleep. Sleep. Eat. Lot of poopin’. Terrific. Say, who’s 2nd grade again? That’s me. How ya doin’, Lizzy? Great. I’m actually Leonardo. Lizzy’s the iguana in Mr. Marculia’s homeroom. You’re… I’m Cinnabun. I know. So corny. Just got renamed again. Oh. Well, beats “Thumper.” I guess. What’s bad are the Hare ones. Hare Brain, Hare Piece, Hare-y Potter… Right, right. Hey, the 2nd graders, you guys do addition, right? …Hare Lip, Hare Club For Men. [cage clangs] Yes, and subtraction. We do both. Great, okay, look. If I got here in 1949, and it’s 2023, what does that make me? Oh. Uh, I know this one. A reptile. Shmuck. [school bell rings] [kindergartners chattering] Okay, it was a false alarm. The school is not on fire. [5th-graders groan] [kindergartners chattering chaotically] No, how old would I be? No. Right, subtraction. Okay, um, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, 74. Seventy-four. Isn’t that right before… [Mrs. Salinas] Upsy-daisies. [Leonardo] Wait, wait! Hold on! That’s the number before 75, isn’t it? What’s the matter? You look upset. [kindergartners chattering chaotically] [extinguisher hisses] [shouts] Cinnabun! [dramatic music plays, ends] [kids chattering] Settle down. [mockingly] I’m a lizard. Ooh. That’s good. Don’t dignify it. Doesn’t matter. I’m doomed. I’m 74 seventy-fifths dead. What? That’s not for class pets. When you’re in captivity, 75 is the new 70. And, hey, you wanna live so bad, a little exercise wouldn’t kill ya. Like what? Blinking’s good. That’d be a start. I blink. [scoffs] Barely. Fine. [grunting] [sighs in exhaustion] Okay. You didn’t have to dive right in. Who am I kiddin’? I can’t start this rigorous workin’ out at this point in my life. It’s too late.

What? Oh, my God. Um, we’re quiet? That’s very good listening, Logan. That’s a heart for you. [joyous music plays] The hearts are for when the kids listen. To motivate good… [vacuum clicking, suctioning] Listening is not a favor. When you listen, you get knowledge, not a carnival prize. We have a chance to go to Magic… [suctioning] Ew. What was that? Peanut butter and ham. My dad overslept. [retches, vomits] [suctions, stops] Okay, well, we’re out of time, so let’s wish Mrs. Salinas well. Bye-bye. But, I… The class is… No, no. I know. Out we go. Better luck with your own kid. Okay, guys, see you in… [tense music plays] [suctions] Moving on. It’s Friday. That means one student has to take home a class pet. What’s this now? Uh, we don’t do that here. Not anymore. No way. In my classroom, you will learn responsibility. You will feed it properly and return it in healthy condition. Alive. Do we have a volunteer? Come on. Somebody raise your hand. What? Remember what happens at the kids’ houses? They forget to feed you or abuse you. [chaotic music playing] [banging] [yelps] [slices] It’ll grow back.

So I go with one of these kids, case the house for open windows, then when I’m alone, zip! I escape. Ha. You couldn’t zip when you were 20. I’m zipping. And then I really live. Maybe climb a tree. Swim in a sewer. See the Everglades. The Everglades? With those untamed animals? Are you nuts? You know they don’t even have names, right? It’s anarchy. You think a rock potato like you can survive there? Your last days will be in a beer ca',\n",
              "  'n. [Ms. Malkin] Let’s go. Who’s gonna take on some responsibility? Or do I have to pick? Well, if no one else will… I don’t want them to feel not wanted. Everybody wants to fit in and shouldn’t be judged on looks, species, foreheads. I have to go indoor skydiving tomorrow, but my father’ll be home, so if it’s okay to… Pick one! Okay, the lizard! [exhales loudly, sighs] [kisses] [school bell rings] [gentle violin music playing] Listen, when you’re out there in the wild and those animals come after you, remember to change your colors and blend in! That’s chameleons. I’m not a chameleon. Oh, well, then you’re a dead man. [amusing music playing] [Summer] Tomorrow’s indoor skydiving. We have to get ready. It’s exactly like skydiving, except you can’t get hurt. Okay, we have a busy weekend. Do I have to wear a dress to Grandma’s? It’ll be pants weather on Sunday. Jayda said the word “puke”. She said it wasn’t a curse word. Is it? I feel bad leaving him. Nobody wants him near the dinner table. He’s good with his water. Back soon! Kayla, don’t look scared of him. That’s being mean. [dog panting] [heavenly music plays] [gasps in awe] It’s on. [inhales sharply] [stretching groans] [joints crack] [groaning continues] [joints cracking] [grunting] [shouts, thuds] [jazzy adventurous music playing] Yeah. He’s nice, the new kid Kabir, but he doesn’t talk a lot, at least not with me. Maybe he’s shy since… [jazzy adventurous music continues] Then I burned my tongue. It didn’t, like, burn off completely, or I couldn’t tell you how I ate my mozzarella sticks. [jazzy adventurous music continues] [panting] [music crescendos, ends] [sighs] [yelps] [grunts] [door opens] Hey, Leonardo. You missed a great movie. Tomorrow I’ll take you down for breakfast. I hope they have everything bagels left. I don’t know why we get sesame bagels. Mom asked me to try one, I was like, “Why would you take off the poppy seeds and the salt…” Wait, where are you? This is a nightmare! I’ll be the kid who killed the lizard, no matter what I do in my life. Whether I do drama, be a doctor… I’ll never be a doctor now. I could work at the DMV. Hopefully, the one next to Quiznos. I don’t wanna go far from my parents. [whimpers, grunts] Mother of Godzilla! What was that? Well? Who said that? The wall? Walls don’t talk. Why would a wall say anything? Why point to it? They say, “If these walls could talk,” because they can’t talk… The trophy! [screams] You said something! You just spoke! Mom! No! You talked! You’re talking! I’m telling Mom, or people will think I’m crazy. I’ll have to go to that school in Tampa for kids with issues! I… [shouting] But please, people can’t know! Why are your hands wet? They’re naturally moist. Please, I’m begging you to keep quiet. If people know I talk, they’ll send me to a scientist or something. But I have to tell someone. Please. [softly] You’re the only one who can hear me. Oh. Then why are you whispering? [softly] Because you were, and it sounded fun. [mimics whispering sounds] Do all lizards talk? I don’t know. I never met them all, but we never talk to humans. Why are you talking to me? Well, I didn’t… [spluttering] Because I want to. I think you’re nice. Really? Thanks. I don’t know if people think I’m nice. It’s so hard to read people at school. People say you’re nice to be nice, and if they say you’re nice, you’ll think they’re cool… I get it. You say “I get it” a lot. That’s ’cause I understand things. That’s all. “I get it.” I’ve been around. Okay. I thought it was something else. Like what? That you want me to stop talking. Oh. Wow. Really? Like, “Wow, that’s crazy”? No, more like, “Wow, I didn’t think you were that self-aware.” [exhales] I can tell. People are too nice to say I talk too much, but I can tell from their faces that I’m talking too much. Like, old people make this face. And babies kind of look sleepy.

This is a nightmare. It’s worse than when I lost my phone. Worse than when my dad wore bike shorts. Worse than when I got lost on a plane, which is hard to do, but really scary. Like a horror movie, though my parents won’t let me watch them, unless you count the furnace in Toy Story 3, but that… Oh. What should we do about it, Jayda? I’m totally telling',\n",
              "  ' my parents about it. My dad has a lot of pull, because he gives the teachers free zit cream, but you should tell yours too. Why are you talking to Summer? I like her now.

Get all your mean jokes in now, ’cause the next kid who takes me home is the last kid. Sure they are, Mr. Chicken-to-leave. Whatever you say, Mr. Wants-to-get-bitten. Oh, I’m shaking, Mr. Almost-as-brave-as-Scooby Doo. [yells] [sighs] Duck, duck, duck, goose! [kindergartners chattering chaotically] Ow! Okay. Okay. All right! That’s not the game. Kids! …the Stamp Act. Eyes up here! For those of you who did the reading… Salinas never taught this stuff. Yeah. What’s a stamp? [Ms. Malkin] …the first tax levied directly on American colonists by the British Parliament. [kids laughing] Skyler, what did I just say? [kids laughing] Answer! How did the colonists react? [kids laughing louder] Demerits! [shurikens slice, then clink] [deliberately] You do not want demerits. What’s a demerit? I think he played for the Clippers. You’re going to leave 5th grade with discipline, or you are never going to leave 5th grade. Eh. [munches] Who has the discipline to take a class pet home this weekend? I’ll do it. I’ll take Leo again. “Leo”? Again? Who would want it twice? [smart board beeping] [kids laughing] [drone whirring] Not one of you is man enough for middle school, are you? [whirring] Ugh. Not now. I’ll take the lizard. Oh, you’ll have so much fun with Leo, Eli. You think, maybe, I can visit? Really? That’d be great.

Just to you. ‘Cause, uh… I’m special? Uh, yeah, that’s right. Oh. Okay. But you can’t tell anyone. They’ll try to kill me like E.T. But my parents told me when someone says, “Don’t tell anyone,” that’s when I have to tell. Well, your parents are right, but that’s with strange humans. I’m just a strange lizard. Okay? Please don’t tell. Especially him. [Eli] The drone? No way. You saw what it did to the Cheetos out there. I mean, it’s nice that it’s loyal. Come on. When I was six, kids thought it was cool. Maybe you should say something about it. I don’t want to hurt its feelings. I know a way. I’ve seen kids break up over the years.

Uh, I don’t have any stuff. Ah, you just gotta find your gimmick. There was a boy in 1998, Mike Djokovic. He memorized all the words to “Walkin’ on the Sun.” Smash Mouth? No? Look, it’s got a lot of words. The point is, plenty of kids have a gimmick. It’s okay. I got a few. Uh, get me a caterpillar. For real? Trust me. [trash can lid clangs] [merry music playing] Oh, that’s perfect. Okay, here we go. [slurps] [laughs] So gross! Wait. [belches] [Eli] What the… [laughing] [Leo] Here, let me show you something. Eli, where’s your safety suit? Try doing this. [grunting] [giggling] Very good. [laughs] [golfer 1] Fore! [Leo grunts] [gasps] [golfer 2] You nailed that thing. [golfer 1] What was it? A possum? [golfer 2] I don’t know, but you hit it in the jellybeans. [golfer 1] Wanna quit and go home? Can’t top that.

[amusing music playing] Yes, I’m back. Where’s your tail? You escaping one limb at a time? Just give me some space. I got hit in the jellybeans. [thuds] I forgot that was there. Salinas was teacher of the year! That substitute lady’s unacceptable. Do the skin cream samples I give out mean nothing to you people? How do I get that horrible woman replaced? Dr. Wenger, please. She’s sitting right here. So? Jay, it’s not polite. Fine. May I speak about you as if you’re not here? Listen, my kid was on track to get into Westlake next year, Langley Prep in three years, Dartmouth in seven years, then a moderately happy marriage in 14 years. I paid for that smart board and this light switch. If I’m letting you keep this animal as her teacher, you’re gonna do something for me to fix this. [ticking] Four seconds. Three, two, one. Pencils down. Except Jayda, who will now be getting two more minutes due to her permanent jet lag. [kids clamoring] [Ms. Malkin] Quiet. No discussion. Now, one of you has to take home a class pet. Volunteer or be assigned. I’ll take Leo again. What is the deal? Leo? Again? You can’t take a pet twice, right? Because I would… I mean, why do you want him again? Um, ’cause he was awesome. Why do you want him? Uh, same reason. Awesome. Wait. If it’s awesome, I want it. It’s supposed to say, “Dr. Skin,” not “Dr. Skid.” S-K-I-N. No D’s. [cat screeching] Jayda, I dyed the cat green.

Not of the snottiness. [Jayda] Look, people don’t realize the pressure someone like me is under. My family is so amazing, so I have a lot more to live up to.

I’ll miss you. [Squirtle repeating mockingly] [Ms. Malkin] If Santa Claus has 39 elves making 1,981 toys an hour… Freezing here. How about giving a guy some shell? Wait. Ho, ho, Mr. Popular, now you wanna come in here with me? It’s 65 degrees. These Central Florida winters are brutal. Just a couple of minutes. Hey, hey! At least buy me dinner first. [Leo, muffled] Wait. Are those my baseball cards? [school bell rings] [mischievous music playing] [slurps] [tongue snapping] [mouthing] Call me. [door shuts] You’re talking to them. That’s why you keep coming back. What',\n",
              "  '? No. Just a little bit. No, no, no, no. There is no little bit. We don’t talk to them. These kids are all benefiting from my insights before I drop dead. Okay, so it’s about your ego. [Leo] That’s not what this is. [Squirtle grunting] It’s about sharing my 74 years of wisdom to help these kids with their issues. Whether it’s breaking up with the drone or having hand-me-down pants. Oh, boo-freakin’-hoo. I had to wear my sister’s shell till I was 16. I made a huge difference with that TJ kid. What? I don’t understand. That’s normal. First one? Usually, it’s in the front, but very nice. You’re growing up. No, no, no. It’s my dad. [somber music plays] [crackling] What’s so funny? I told him that Dave Connaire, in 1974, all of a sudden, grew a nose the size of a Buick just like his dad’s. And everybody still loved him, ’cause he was a cool kid, like you. And the next week, Cole’s problem was even tougher. You won’t do sleepovers, ’cause you say things in your sleep? Well, if I’m not gonna tell anyone about you talking to me, do you promise not to tell anyone? Yeah. Of course. [groans] This isn’t my real voice. [high-pitched] I really talk like this. I can’t let them know. I sound ridiculous. [crackling] This is priceless. Well, I fixed it. I told him… You sound like a young Bee Gee. A what? How ’bout The Weeknd? Know him? [sings The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My Face”] Yeah, like that. [Leo] Last week, he sang at the winter recital, and I heard they went nuts. [crowd cheering] Nice job, Ms. Malkin. I’m sorry, was that praise? [laughs] Keep it up, and we may see more of you here. [Leo] The class did great. [Squirtle] Did they win? [Leo] Nah, kindergarten always wins. Way too cute. [instruments clatter] [kindergartners chatter indistinctly] And you should’ve seen me last week with Mia. [Squirtle] You mean Huggy? The human cling wrap? [Leo] Excuse me. She has a name. As you know, her parents were recently divorced. Only two hours late today. Very considerate. Are you letting him cut his own hair now? [engine revs] [tires screech] You can’t watch the kids next weekend, so me and Aurora can have Valentine’s Day together? I’m asking you one favor! You don’t have any plans. Because I know. [clears throat] I’m sorry, but lizards do not talk. Parrots, macaws, songbirds, and certain killer whales. Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet. Why would you only talk to me? ‘Cause you’re nice. You’re great at school, answering all the questions. I love to learn things. You’re a lot quieter around your family. Don’t you ever wanna let ’em see how big that brain of yours is? My brother and sister think I’m weird. Really? You just looked like my grandpa. Yeah? Is that a good thing? Uh-huh. My grandpa used to talk to me. He really liked science, and he would ask me questions, even if he knew the answer. [sniffles] What? He sounds like a great guy. He was my best friend. [cries, sniffles] Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn’t mean to get that going. Please, kid, I hate that. [sobbing softly] I’m sorry. Oh, no, no. Don’t be sorry. Just stop. I… I can’t handle it.

I didn’t know how to help her, so I just listened. And that helped. Wow. So you got this E.T. scam going. Got every kid thinking he’s Elliott? This will end badly. All I know is these kids’ll remember me. Did you hear about Hammy #3’s funeral last week? Hammy #3 died? Didn’t know that. Exactly. [Leo] They say the funeral was a snooze. No one had anything to say. I liked that white spot over his ear. I liked the way he breathed. He gave me pinkeye. My funeral is gonna be packed with fond remembrances and anecdotes. [belches, slurps] Yeah, good for you and your last week’s vocabulary words. And, buddy, that funeral could come sooner than you think. [kids yelling] Me! Me! My turn with the Geico thing!

Help me! What? [Squirtle] I got your back. I couldn’t let you do this one alone. What are you gonna do? You lay back. It’s harder to hurt me. I got the shell. What about giving advice? Oh, like I don’t know anything? I can do what you do. [crowd cheering on phone] [Anthony] Mm. [commentator] That was an incredible move! What strategy! Hey! [commentator] …starting to let his… Go straight to his head. Hey, over here. [yells] What? Ah! [clattering] Oh, come on! Forget that. I talk. Oh my God. Grandma! No, no, no. Stop, stop. Can’t do that or we’ll all die. What? Why? I don’t know. I… I’m telling you. You… You’ll die. Just shut up. Calm down. Oh, okay. Fix your phone later. I’m a talking turtle. I picked you ’cause… “I like your style.” Take it down a notch. I got this. Now, tell me your problems. What? I… I can fix your problems. I… I… I… I seen a lot of things in that 5th grade room, and I can help. So come on. I don’t have any problems. Other than I broke my phone. Ah-ha. Bully. I get it. Come on. You’re insecure, right? Every class bully is. No. I don’t know. You’re sad, you got something tearing you up inside. Just say it. I’m a talking turtle. I can’t tell anyone else. Of course I’m a bully. I don’t know what else to do. I’m just different. I’m not smart. Nah. Everyone’s smart in some way. You’re just afraid of trying and looking not smart. That’s textbook. What’s a textbook? You know what? Never mind. I’m different in other ways too. There you go. Come on. Out with it. You won’t say anything? No. What is it? What’s the sadness? [sighs] I don’t know how babies are made. Perfect. That’s very class bully. Tough on the outside, a self-hating pile of cottage cheese on the inside. Can you just tell me? Oh. About babies? Sure. Here we go. [clears throat] First, the daddy climbs on the mommy’s back while she’s swimming. He reaches under the mommy to find her cloaca. This goes on for about 24 hours. Then the mommy comes ashore, makes a nest, and deposits eggs in the sand. My mom made eggs in the sand? Yes. So the fish don’t eat ’em. [ball tapping] I crushed it. Totally fixed the kid’s problem. The taping me up, maybe it’s ’cause he wants to keep me. [tape tearing off] [Squirtle screams] Stop!

              "  'd about being behind? This is a tough time, but these are the best years. Believe me. Enjoy not knowing everything. Enjoy being a kid. You’re a good one. Do you miss being a kid? I’m just glad I’m still here. [kids laughing] [tapping] Okay, every one of you has had a weekend with Leo here. So from here on, you’ll be taking home… [sighs] What’s the turtle’s name again? Squirtle. My name is Squirtle. I think it’s Squirtle. Squirtle sucks. I beg your pardon? Why? I don’t know. He just sucks. I like Leo, though. He’s nice. The best. [kid 1] Yeah! Come on… [Logan] Leo’s better than that turtle. Oh, stop that noise. Stop it! What is so special about this reptile? I like his skin. His skin is like my grandma’s elbows. Uh, same. Same. Same. Elbows. [kids] Same. All right. If you all so desperately want to take home that lizard again, you’ll just have to earn it. [kids speaking indistinctly] [Cole W.] I wanna get picked! We’ll do our homework and promise to bring it in. You will all make my class a model of excellence, and even win that Academicathalon, or it’s the turtle for all of you. [kid] Yes! Thank you so much. Was this your dying wish? To turn a bunch of brats against me? It’s not about us. It’s about the kids. They’re motivated. They’re gonna finish the year strong. [“When It’s Us” playing] [crowd cheering] [excitedly] Yes! [cheering] [inaudible dialogue] Yeah, Louis Pasteur is the father of microbiology. He discovered that dangerous microorganisms could grow in open water. [“When It’s Us” keeps playing] [thunder booms, rumbles] [wind howling] Wow! Well, now, that’s impressive. [all applauding] [song ends] Class 5-C, you’re one step away from going to Magic Land Park! [kids cheer] How great a job has our teacher done? Bravo, Ms. Malkin. [kids applaud] I know a lot of parents weren’t happy when I first brought you in, due to your rep as a miserable person. But if you win the History Fair on Saturday, we’ll… You’ll prove all the doubters wrong. Well, Principal Spahn, in the classroom, sometimes the old ways are the best ways. I can’t believe it. [air horn blares] Back to your posts. No five-highing. [Leo] Oh, that pic is fire. [Skyler, on phone] Thank you. Hey, what is the deal? I’ve been waiting for your next Jenga move for 30 minutes. Now did you make the costume or did your mom? Tell the truth. You know I won’t tell anyone. I only talk to you. [phone ringing] What? [Skyler] Is that another phone? Uh, I don’t know. Uh, must be on Malkin’s desk or something. [phone 2 rings] Oh. [Skyler] Hello? Come on. [Skyler] Leo, where’d you go? [bleeps, chimes] I… I’ll be right there. [Skyler] Leo? [groans] [phone 3 ringing] [Skyler] Hello? Hey, pal, toss it here. I’ll handle it. [phone rings, stops] [Skyler] Can you hear me? [sighs] [Skyler] Leo? Yeah, I think Malkin must have an extra phone. Anywho, what did Summer say? Oh my God, you can’t all play Jackie Kennedy. And, like, we so wanna slay this History Fair. [Skyler] I know. That Magic Land Park trip would be awesome. [Leo, feedback-like] Hey, you’re awesome because you tried your best. [Skyler, feedback-like] That’s why I’m your special friend? [Leo chuckles] Yeah. [door creaks open] You talk to Skyler too? I… I just… Only because she… That’s Summer’s phone in there, right behind yours. [mischievous music playing] You happy now? For ruining this? I don’t know what happened. I… I must’ve butt-dialed ya. I mean, butt-shot ya. You don’t even have a butt. [gasps] How dare you? [sad music playing] You talk to all of us? You said I was the only one. You said I was the only one. I thought I was special. You’re all special. I… [all speaking indistinctly] [Leo] I’m sorry! I just… [gasps] Seeing you guys getting along and doing great in class, it felt like I was actually making a difference. You did. This year would’ve been a nightmare without you helping me. [Summer] Ms. Malkin’s so mean. Talking to you made the class bearable. [Leo] I was just worried if you all knew… [gasps, breathes heavily] …other people would find out. You told me not to tell anyone, and I didn’t. Nobody did. Because we can keep a secret. [Logan] Yeah. What, did you tell everyone I shave my unibrow? Because I don’t. Hey, the only one he told about your unibrow, or that you still eat your boogers, was me. And I barely chuckled. What? I’m leaving. I tried. [Leo] Wait, it’s Friday. Aren’t you gonna take me home? Summer, it’s your turn. Please, I’m so sorry. How can we trust you now? That was a question. [door creaks] All right, what’s everyone doing here? Oh, you’re leaving. Good. Take the whole day off. You need to rest up for the history fair tomorrow. Go home. Go. Shoo. Come on, out you go. [door beeps, shuts] [curious music playing] You and I have a lot to talk about. I don’t understand. I… I know I lied to the kids. What did I do to you? Excuse me, talking to my students behind my back? Advising them? Okay. I feel terrible, but I was just trying to… Undermine my methods! Cheat me out of feeling any satisfaction from their success. What? They learned everything you wanted. Why wouldn’t that make you happy? Don’t think you can analyze me. I’m an adult. Not a shrieking brat who thinks reading Canterbury Tales is torture. It’s not torture? Quiet! Asking me to be happy when I have nothing but these four walls. What about your family? Excuse me, do you see any family? Oh. Uh, not unless you’re related to the gym coach.

              "  't? You are special. [indistinct chattering] [Cole H.] I couldn’t sleep last night. I couldn’t stop thinking about what Leo did to us. Let’s just not talk about Leo. We’re done with Leo. We’re ready. We can win this thing ourselves. [door opens] Good morning, my dear students. [door creaks] They look confident. You sounded nice. Real warm. Thank you. I’ll keep you posted when I can. [peppy music playing] [indistinct chattering] I’m Betsy Ross. I designed the first American Flag in 1776. But I didn’t just say what I thought the flag should look like, I listened to others to see what they thought. The result was the superior design we have today, and also, people liking me more. I’m Susan B. Anthony. I played a pivotal role in the women’s suffrage movement in the 19th century. But I’m not that special or great. And neither is my family. So I can relate to average women who couldn’t vote until 1920. I’m Winston Churchill. “We shall fight on the beaches.” “We shall fight them in the fields and in the streets.” “We shall never surrender, but we shall let them down easy, with a nice letter.” “So they don’t lose their minds.” This is wonderful. You’ve taught them life lessons. I… I can’t hear anything. Can you open your pocket? They burned me, Joan of Arc, at the stake, but I am not afraid. Boo-freaking-hoo! Everyone’s got problems. I talked about it to a friend and felt a lot better. [audience applauding] Aw, I think that friend is you. [Principal Spahn] Malkin’s Marvels, you’re going to Magic Land Park! Congratulations, class! [audience applauds and cheers] [TJ’s dad] Yeah! And to the first substitute to ever win Teacher of the Year! [audience cheering] You’ll be chaperoned by Ms. Malkin and Coach Kimura. [chuckles] Oh… [triumphant music playing] Is it over? We win? When do I come out? [muffled] What’s happening? Ms. Malkin, can we go see Leo? Honey, it’s about to rain. We can’t go to our class for one second? You know what the rain does to my extensions. [sighs] I gotta say, I thought you were some kind of a twisted animal. A rabid, bitter bag of mothballs foaming at the mouth. But I’ve never seen my Jayda speak like that. It’s like she’s, uh, nice? That’s our Ms. Malkin! [Kabir’s mom] You really got to know our kids. What a special lady. Get this woman a full-time job next year. [chuckles] Oh, I think we can arrange that. [Summer’s mom] She’s helped Summer make friends. [Cole H.’s dad] Cole’s proud of his voice, thanks to you. [Logan’s mom] How’d you do it? Well… You know… [Leo grunting, yelling] That’s, um… my stomach. I… I better go. [air horn blares] She’s not gonna make it. What happened? I couldn’t hear nothing. Did we win? I thought I was gonna see the kids. We’re going somewhere very special. We’re all going to celebrate? What, a pizza party? [dramatic music playing] Wow, this pizza’s out in the boonies. [engine revs] [grunts] What’s goin’ on? You’re leaving me here? What about the kids? They lost. The class embarrassed themselves and blamed you. What? What was all that cheering? That was for the other class. I’m sorry. What did I do? I’ve never felt so bad. Don’t say that. You said the Everglades was your dream. Now you can live it out, with no chance of ever running into the children. Or their parents. Or the principal. Or the media. I said it was my dream. The kids are what I… [engine revs] [brakes squeal] [sighs] [engine revs] [tires screech] [ominous music playing] [frogs croaking] [alligator growls] [yelps] [devices ringing, beeping] [Mia] What? [Cole H.] Where is he? [Summer] Is he hiding? [Cole H.] He’s not hiding. He was here. You seen him? [Jayda] What happened? What a shame. He must’ve run away. [kids gasp] [vacuum thuds] [tinkling] He left us? Oh, look. There seems to be some kind of note. Leo could write? Of course. He could talk. Oh! He talked to you people too? Oh, I thought I was special. “Dear class.” “I’ve greatly enjoyed my time with you this year, but I wish to move on and finally see the world.” “I realize I broke your trust, and that can’t be fixed.” “But if you would be so kind, please keep our conversations secret, so that I’m not harassed, like E.T. or The Iron Giant, or Splash, or the classic, The Shape of Water.” “Simply attribute your success to Ms. Malkin, whose integrity is beyond reproach.” [chuckles] “Best Regards, Leo.” Well, let’s try and be happy for Leo. He’s doing what he wanted most. But we never even got to thank him. That’s life, gang. Life gets more difficult the older we get. It’s called growing up.

Why you talking about your funeral? ‘Cause it’s coming any day. I’m almost 75 years old. So what? We live to, like, 110. What? But Skyler’s dad said… A hundred and ten, unless eaten by alligators.

We couldn’t celebrate. We needed to see you before you die. Oh. Uh, who told you I was dying? The turt… Uh, Squirtle told us. Well, I thought I was, but I found out I’m not. [kids] You’re not? You’re not gonna die? You’re not still mad? [Anthony] This is incredible. We love you, Leo. [Summer] Are you crazy? This is amazing! [sobs] [Skyler] I’m so happy!

Sorry about busting you. I want you to have something. [tearing] [gentle music playing] [whirs] Least I could do. It’s okay. Put it back on. You’re gonna get arrested. [mouse squeaking] You should all be proud. We’ve all learned so much this year. Now, before I go, I want to finish something else that Mrs. Salinas started. I’m going to read the rest of Charlotte’s Web. [blows] Ugh, is she kidding? Let’s just get through it. “Charlotte was dying.” “‘But I feel peaceful, ‘ she said.” “‘Your success in the ring was, to a small degree, my success.'” “‘Why did you do all this for me?’ Wilbur asked.” “‘Because I liked you, ‘ replied Charlotte.” “‘After all, what’s life, anyway?'” [sniffling] [Ms. Malkin] “‘We’re born, we live a little while, we die.'” [crying] [Ms. Malkin] “‘Perhaps, I was trying to lift my life a trifle.'” “‘Anyone’s life can stand a little of…'” [bawling] What? I was wrong, okay? Crying’s doin’ so good for me. [blows nose] Still wish I could eat spider babies. Nobody’s eating any spider babies! [lively music plays] Hi, guys! [kids] Mrs. Salinas.

The tragedy leaves Brian physically wounded and emotionally shattered, his vocal cords damaged to the point of near-silence. Consumed by grief and rage, Brian embarks on a brutal quest for revenge against the gang responsible, transforming himself into a silent vigilante fueled by his pain.\\nThrough a combination of intense training and self-taught combat skills, Brian becomes a formidable force, navigating the underbelly of the city with a silent fury. The film’s minimalist dialogue emphasizes the visual storytelling, showcasing John Woo’s signature balletic gunfights and action sequences, often infused with his trademark doves and slow-motion cinematography.\\nAs Brian hunts down his targets, one by one, he clashes with the charismatic and ruthless gang leader, Playa (played by Harold Torres). Their confrontation forms the film’s climax, a violent ballet of vengeance set against the backdrop of a snowy Christmas Eve. Silent Night explores themes of loss, grief, and the seductive nature of revenge. It’s a raw and emotional journey, punctuated by moments of breathtaking action and John Woo’s signature visual flair. * * * * * * (MUSIC BOX PLAYING GENTLE MELODY) (SIREN BLARING) (MUSIC BOX STOPS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (BELL JINGLING) (GODLOCK PANTING) (BELL JINGLING) (SIRENS BLARING) (TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (BACKGROUND CHATTER) (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GUNFIRE) (SIRENS WAILING) (GUN FIRING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR ENGINES SPEEDING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (INDISTINCT LAUGHTER) (GODLOCK GRUNTS, PANTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR HORN HON',\n",

Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, H.E.R., Halle Bailey, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi\\nRelease dates: November 20, 2023 (London), December\\xa025,\\xa02023\\xa0(United States)\\nRunning time: 141 minutes The 2023 film adaptation of The Color Purple offers a profound exploration of Alice Walker‘s renowned novel, presenting a vivid portrayal of endurance, sisterhood, and self-realization set against a backdrop of deep-seated racism and sexism. This adaptation enriches the narrative with its emotional depth and complexity. Act I: The Emergence of Adversity and Hope: In rural Georgia of the early 1900s, we are introduced to Celie (Danielle Brooks), a young Black woman enduring severe mistreatment at the hands of her father, Alfonso (Louis Gossett Jr.). Her life is a series of tragedies, marked by the loss of her two children and an enforced marriage to the callous widower Albert “Mister” Johnson (Colman Domingo). Her only comfort comes through secret letters to her sister Nettie (H.E.R.), who escapes their father’s tyranny to join missionaries in Africa. These letters become Celie’s outlet, a means to articulate her anguish and yearn for a brighter existence. Celie’s life takes a turn with the arrival of Shug Avery (Taraji P. Henson), a bold singer and Mister’s lover. Enthralled by Shug’s freedom and charm, Celie forms a deep connection with her, learning about love and reclaiming her self-esteem. Shug’s influence empowers Celie to confront the abuse she faces from Mister. Act II: The Growth of Sisterhood and Rebellion: Despite societal judgment and jealousy, Celie’s bond with Shug flourishes, igniting a sense of defiance in her. She allies with Sofia (Halle Bailey), Mister’s assertive daughter-in-law, and Squeak (Ciara), Sofia’s partner, who also suffers Mister’s scorn. Together, these women create a haven of mutual support, finding comfort in music and stories, and resist the suppression imposed upon them. Sofia’s bold stance against Mister leads to her imprisonment, a pivotal moment that strengthens Celie’s resolve to liberate herself. She embarks on a journey of self-education, discovering her voice through poetry and music. Act III: The Path to Self-Discovery and Healing: As time passes and societal change swirls around her, Celie experiences transformative moments. Nettie’s return brings revelations about their family and\\noffers closure to Celie’s long-held sorrows. Simultaneously, Mister experiences a personal evolution, recognizing the resilience and fortitude of the women he’s wronged, and seeks to make amends. Celie, now embracing her newfound strength and autonomy, establishes a juke joint, a lively haven for women to celebrate their identities and express themselves without restraint. She openly accepts her sexuality and revels in life’s myriad possibilities. The 2023 adaptation of The Color Purple transcends a straightforward plot, weaving a rich, layered narrative that reflects both personal and collective transformation. It highlights the resilience of women and the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood, prevailing against overwhelming odds. * * * * * * [banjo playing] [horse hooves clopping] [clapping] [sister 1] ♪ Hey, sister Whatcha gon’ do? ♪ [sister 2] ♪ Going down by the river Gonna play with you ♪ ♪ Papa don’t like No screaming round here ♪ ♪ No lip from a woman When they chug that beer ♪ ♪ Sho’ nuff sun gon’ shine ♪ ♪ Gonna be grown ladies Of the marrying kind ♪ ♪ Sho’ nuff moon gon’ rise ♪ ♪ Like a huckleberry pie In the middle of the sky ♪ ♪ Gonna be all right Gonna be all right ♪ [both chuckling] [sister 1 sighs] [sister 1] Nettie.

No. Not vain, Miss Celie. God just wants to share a good thing. You see, I think it pisses God off if you walk past the color purple and not notice it. You saying God wants to be loved like it say in the Bible? Oh, everything and everybody wants to be loved. Especially God. That’s why God be in everything. And see, when you love what God has made, you is loving God and God is loving you. You see, God is in music and the water, in the sunlight. [chuckles] God be… he be as big as the sun, yet small enough to fit in all our hearts. I been wondering… if God love me, then why he take my babies? And why he take my Nettie?

He probably somewhere passed out. I’ll take the mail. Take care now. “Nettie”? Mercy to glory! Celie! [squeals] Celie! Celie, get up! You got a letter. Get up! It’s from her. Her? Your Nettie! Come on. “Dear Celie, I hope this reaches you, as I’ve been writing you every week f for years. I suppose you didn’t get any of my letters because– because you ha haven’t written back.” [breathes shakily] Nettie alive. Yes. [Celie chuckles, breathes shakily] “You probably won’t get this either, because Mister is still probably the only one who takes mail from the box.” [sighs',\n",
              "  '] “But if you do get this, I want you to know, I love you, and I’m not dead.” [sobs] There’s got to be more of ’em somewhere around here. Come on. [Celie chuckles] Pa. [sighs] Hey, Pa. Come on, now. Pa, get up! Come on, now. Oh! Oh, shit. Oh. Come on. Come on. Well, hey. [chuckles] Hey. Hey, why you gotta wake me dr Oh! Ooh! You almost stepped on my toe! Come on!

Stay a bit longer. For what? It’s okay. Stay a little longer. I’ll be back. Oh. [band members chattering] Hey. Take me with you. Next time. I’ll be back before you can spell Mississippi. Come on, fellas. [exhales sharply] [breathing heavily] [Nettie] Dear Celie, when Mister forced me off his land, I got a job working for a pastor across town. I help take care of their babies for food and shelter. They told me they were going to Africa as missionaries. While we were on a great boat to Africa, the reverend told me he and his wife couldn’t bear chil’ren. But God sent them two. They showed me the name you had sewn on the baby’s blanket, and I knew the babies were yours. It’s a miracle! Adam and Olivia are right here with me. My babies. They alive. And they with Nettie. [Asante tribespeople singing] [rhythmic music playing] [Nettie] It was like Black seeing Black for the first time. Celie, we are more than just kings and queens. We’re at the center of the universe. Dear Celie, I hope this letter finds you well. [British soldiers shouting] Life has become dire for us. Our village was bombed in order to make way for a road to grow cocoa trees. [British colonial soldiers shouting] [Asante tribespeople screaming] [Nettie] The British colonial administrators ignored our pleas to let us keep our land. We couldn’t fight ’em, so now we walk to a refugee camp across the border. I have faith that God will let us see each other before we die. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to recognize each other. Celie! Why supper late? [inhales sharply] Because I I lost track of time I works the land from sunup to sundown, breaking my back. All you gots to do is cook and clean, and you can’t even do that. [Celie breathing heavily] I– I’ll do better. That’s what ya mouth say. [gasps] Clean it up! If I gots to eat late, you won’t eat at all. [sighs] [Sofia] There we go. Y’all, scoot on real good. Make sure there some room. [chuckles] Miss Celie! Hop on in. We going into town! I can’t. I got work round the house. [Sofia] Work can wait. Come on, girl. I ain’t seen you since Jesus wept. Come on in. [scoffs] [Buster] Come on, now. My treat. [Sofia] Get in here! [Sofia, younger child chuckling] [Sofia] Oh, girl, these kids ain’t driving you crazy, are they? [Celie] No, I like your kids. [younger child] Yeah, yeah. I don’t know, sister. [chuckles] Oh! [chuckles] Yeah, sure. Y’all want some ice cream? [younger child] Ice cream! Let’s go get some ice cream. Y’all been so good today. I want an ice cream. Now hold on, lil’ junior. Let me get you now. There you go. Now don’t be asking this man all these questions.

Harpo and Squeak keep a close eye on your children. And And then Buster, he help out every now and then. Though I fear the incident broke him some. But Harpo love his kids like they his own.

When your letter arrived in the village, I stared at it for an hour before I could open it. My hands trembled so. I cried enough to make– Celie! I thought I told you not to touch the mail. [grunts] [cries] Shug’s coming shortly. Come shave me. [coughs] [gasps] [inhales sharply] [Mister] Celie! Get the molasses out your ass! [sniffs] Keep your hands steady.

Miss Celie. We’s married ladies now. Come on. What you got to eat? [distorted] All right. Nice to meet you. [Grady] Mighty fine supper, Miss Celie. I’m full as a tick on a big ol’ dog.

Well, the time has come for me to tell y’all, me and Grady can’t stay. Mmm, yeah, we gotta get on the road ‘fore dusk. Y’all just got here. I know, but, uh, Grady gotta get back to work tomorrow. Mmhmm. Also… we taking Celie with us. Ain’t that right, Cel? [sighs] Come again? Celie is coming to Memphis with us. It’s time she saw more of this world. [scoffs] I’d die before I let that happen. Good. That’s just the going away present I been needing. Hey! Watch yourself! You better handle your woman. [stutters] She done found her mouth. She’s just being stupid. What’s gotten into you, dummy? I done had enough of you. That’s what’s gotten into me. It’s time I be free from you and enter to creation. You ain’t gon’ be talking to my boy that way. Not in my house. Maybe if he hadn’t been your boy, he might at least be an inch of a man. Watch your mouth! You took my sister Nettie away from me. And you hid her letters all these years, and you knew she was the only person love me. But Nettie alive. [Harpo] What? She is. And my chil’ren with Nettie in Africa. And when they get home, us all together, we gon’ whup your country ass! Watch your mouth in my house! It’s about time to load the luggage. No, no. Come on, Miss Celie, why don’t you go and have some peas and be civil now? Harpo, your daddy made my life hell on earth. He ain’t nothing but a sack of dead horse shit. And horse shit belong in the ground. [chuckling] She called him a sack of dead horse shit. Now if that ain’t worth the joy of laughter, I don’t know what is. Harpo, pass me them peas. [laughing] [crying] I wanna thank you, Miss Celie… for everything you’ve done for me. I was feeling mighty bad, rotting in that prison cell. But you came and seen about me every week without fail. [breathes shakily] That’s how I knows there’s a God. ‘Cause he’s living in you. The women at this table have lost their minds. Shut up, you old toothless goat! You leave me, you’re not gettin’ a thin dime. Not a red cent. [Mister] Come on! Come on! [Shug] Celie, no! [Harpo] No, no! [Sofia] It ain’t worth it, Miss Celie! Did I ever ask you for anything? [Mister panting] Not even your old sorry hand in marriage! [Shug] Come on, Celie. Let’s go! Let’s go! Sofia can take care of this. [Sofia] Oh, yeah. Sofia born to take care of this. Y’all go on! It’s always something. Now where you going? I wants to go to Memphis too. And do what? [chuckling] Oh, come on now. Squeak! My name ain’t Squeak. It’s Mary Agnes. Come on now. Come on, Squeak. [Sofia laughing] Old Sofia home now! [chuckles] There’s gon’ be some changes made! [chuckling] [softly] She’ll be back, Pa. She’ll be back. [shouting] You’ll be back! Where you gon’ go? Shug got talent. And looks. All you fit to do is clean her slop jar and cook her food. And you ain’t even that good a cook! Until you do right by me, everything you think about gon’ crumble. You Black, you poor, you ugly, you a woman. I should’ve kept you under my shoe like the roach you is. Everything done to me, already done to you.

Who? [cork pops, guests cheer] Miss Celie. You got a call. Who is it? Don’t know but sounds urgent. Evening. This is Celie. Sweet, loving God, we thank you for the life of Mr. Alfonso Harris. And we thank you for his daughter Celie, who we welcome back home. And likewise, we thanks you for his wife, dear sister Mary Ellen, who we are praying for in her hour of bereavement. Mr. Alfonso was a man. A hardworking man. Now, sure, he was difficult and, uh, stubborn. Now you’re preaching. [person in church shushes] And I’d be a liar if I told you for certain that Mr. Alfonso made it to the pearly gates. [congregation] Mmhmm. [Sofia chuckles] [reverend] What I do know is we must forgive, and ask forgiveness from others, or God will be hardpressed to show his mercy toward us. [congregation murmurs] [reverend] So don’t tarry, church. For no one knows what day, what hour, we will see our F',\n",
              "  'ather again. Amen? Amen. [congregation] Amen. Ezekiel, if you will. [piano playing] [Mary Ellen] God bless you. [First Lady] Good to see you. God bless you. [Mary Ellen] Bless you. Really enjoyed your sermon, Pa. Especially what you what you said about forgiveness and– Ain’t the time right now. Reverend’s busy. God bless you, baby. God bless you. Good to see you. Good to see you. Meet me at the store. I got something to tell you. What’s this for? The place is yours. He didn’t leave it to you? No, ma’am. It wasn’t his to give. You didn’t know? We wasn’t quite on speaking terms. Well, when I went to settle Alfonso’s will, I found out from the lawyer that this wasn’t his land nor his store. Your real pa built this place. Alfonso… was my pa. No, ma’am. When your daddy died, your ma married Alfonso. After she died, Alfonso took over the store. Your real daddy even put you and your sister’s name on the deed. That’s how I know this here land belongs to y’all. I had a ma… and a pa that loved me. Dear God… I hope this place brings you and your sister comfort.

[Nettie] Dear Celie, the letters you’ve sent fill my days with joy. I know it must’ve been hard finding me. We’ve had to relocate several times over the years. The British have seized the east. We lost our passports and documentation when our village was burned. I’ve decided it’s best that me and your children make our way back home to you. Celie, we need your help getting back to the States. As soon as you get this, please go to the immigration office to prove our citizenship. You’re our only hope. Mr. Johnson? [Mister sighs] [immigration officer] Even if we could find them, which I doubt, it’ll cost you hundreds to get ’em here from Africa. Well, uh… I thanks ya. Mmhmm. Say, uh… I gots me some land. I could sell some of it and get the money. Think that’ll help? Well, that would definitely help. My secretary can start the paperwork. [jazz playing on radio] [knocking on door] We’re closed. [Mister] Evening. Hate to bother you. This gon’ sound odd, but, um… I came to buy some pants. I can come back later if it’s too much trouble. I also brought you this. [Celie] Hmm. Oh. [radio clicks off] See something you like? [sighs] Oh, uh… Why don’t I just take one of the ones that no one else buys? [chuckles] Help your business out some. You… [sighs] You looking nice. You sure you wanna be seen in these? [chuckles] I don’t mind. Give folks something to laugh at. [sighs] I best be locking up. It’s getting late. That it is. Thank you. Say, uh… maybe someday, uh, you and me, we could, uh– I don’t know, if, uh if you feel like it sometime… Let’s just us be friends. Oh. Yeah. [chuckles] [chuckles] [bell jingling] [chuckles] Hmm.

Plot Summary: Dan Morgan (Mark Wahlberg), a top-secret assassin living a double life as a suburban dad, finds his carefully constructed world thrown into chaos when his past catches up to him. Former enemies track him down, forcing Dan to pack his unsuspecting wife (Michelle Monaghan), teenage daughter, and 10-month-old baby into their minivan and embark on a spontaneous cross-country road trip to Las Vegas.\\nAs they navigate the highways and face a series of hilarious and perilous situations, Dan must keep his family safe from his pursuers while also trying to hold onto his carefully crafted suburban persona. The family encounters quirky characters, learns valuable lessons about each other, and ultimately discovers the true meaning of family in the face of danger. * * * [person] There comes a time in every man’s life when he asks himself… “Am I living the life I should be?” “Or am I capable of something greater?” “Is there a change that I can make in my life right now to become the best version of myself? Who do I wanna be?” What is the life that I wanna have? What is the face that I wanna present to the world? These are the kinds of questions that keep you up at night. And when you’re behind the wheel of a high-performance automobile like this, no one asks those questions. They know you are that guy. You have that life. Huh? [chuckles, smacks lips] Maybe I should look for something less cool. Can I be honest? That’s your ex talking. [sighs] We gotta get your confidence back. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it is never too late to become the man that you’ve always wanted to be. [manager] Dan! I don’t know how you do it. Guy looks like he just got himself a Lambo. Hey, one man’s lemon is another man’s lemonade. He just needed a squeeze. Well, it’s earned you Salesman of the Month again. [chuckles] [engine revs] [salesman 1] Whoo! Nice! [tires squeal] Hey, Deb. Can you take a photo of Dan for the website, please? Uh, you know what? I actually… [stammers] I’m sorry, I gotta get home. It’s my anniversary. Oh, come on, Dan. You do this every time. [stammers] Give it to Hal. [Hal] What’s up, losers? [sighs] Hal, how many times have I told you about driving on the lot like that? Cars are like chicks, Jorge. They wanna go fast. [sighs] Your fly’s open. Hmm? Uh, Dan… Uh, come on. Don’t make me give it to this guy. Oh, come on. I mean, he’s just got his teeth done. Hmm? Go get ’em, Hal.

[song ends] [dog barking] [children playing, indistinct] [person 2] I told you already, Nina. Stanford is restrictive early action. If you apply to Iowa now, you could mess it all up. I know what I’m doing. Do you? It certainly doesn’t look like it from here. Happy anniversary! [sighs] Aw, baby. You remembered. [chuckles] Hey. You thought I forgot. Can you please tell Nina that we’re not paying for her to follow Trevor to Iowa? Don’t say his name like that. Like what? [sighs] [scoffs] Come on. [squeals] Max! Crushing the peas. [babbles] Ah, that’s a good boy. [kisses] Hey, buddy. How was your day? [mumbles] You got any plans this weekend? Mm-mmm. Come on. We’ll go in the yard, throw a few pitches, see if you got any gas left in this cannon. Come on, bud. [grumbles] Where you going? Samir’s. Again? You made me quit gaming so I’d make friends. I made you quit gaming because blowing people’s heads off 24-7 isn’t exactly healthy. You know, you’re meant to be babysitting tonight. It’s our anniversary. What? Why can’t she? What, because I’m a woman? That is not what I’m saying. That’s what you’re saying to me. It’s not. What is wrong with you? [Nina] Are you kidding? Is this Trevor? Who’s talking now? [Nina] Really? Do you have a life other than just freaking pissing me off? Is it Nina or Trevor? [Nina] I’m serious… All right. Come on. Come on. Stop it, okay? Please. Look, Nina. Can you cover for your brother tonight? It might be good for him to finally get out of the house, and you can work on your application. [sighs deeply] Fine. You’re welcome. Thank you. [exhales heavily] [sighs] Look, can you just… Can you talk to Mom and ask her to, like, lay off of me? Because I’m a grown woman. [mother] I heard that, Nina. I’ll talk to her. But seriously, Beans… No, don’t call me that. No. What happened to journalism at Stanford? Wasn’t that the dream? Journalism is dead, Dad. [mother scoffs] Yeah, right. Is that something that Trevor said, or… [scoffs] Yeah, really. He shouldn’t say that. [Nina] Really? Yes. He shouldn’t be putting ideas in your head. [Nina] I’m brainwashed. My God. Honey, I am so glad it’s not just me. Oh, my gosh. All right, Maxie. Okay. I’m gonna put him to bed. And then? Are we still doing this? Oh, we’re doing it. Awesome.

Eighteen years. Can you believe it? It’s nuts we keep coming back here every year for Twisted Cyclone. What? No, no. I meant 18 years married. And I thought you loved this tradition. I do! I do. Are you sure? I did. I just… I don’t know, you’re such a creature of habit. I love that about you. You know, we make, uh, tacos on Wednesdays… Well, Tuesday, everybody’s doing it. And we have sex on Thursdays. If we can get the kids out of the house. I know. We gotta get them out more… I know. No one makes a better… If we want more time. …weekly planner than you do, but… [inhales deeply] …I don’t know. Maybe I just wanna be a little bit more spontaneous and travel, or… I kind of feel like we don’t really go anywhere. Well, I mean… Well, we got the kids, and they got school, they got routines and friends… Oh, what friends? And just all that type of stuff. Kyle has one friend which, by the way, he never even invites over. Yeah, but he’s a human with a pulse. I’ll take it. [chuckles] God. Nina’s the one I’m worried about. I know. She’s so anti-establishment. Mm-hmm. She’s anti the system. She’s anti… Anti me. Oh, come on. You know it’s true. [both sighing] I’m sorry. Sorry. No, no, no. Now’s not the time. You’re right. Now is the time to nut up and get ready for the near-death adrenaline rush of Buffalo’s 1998 winner of the fourth-finest roller coaster. I know. I know. It’s good. Do you think you can handle it? Do you think I can still handle it? [screaming] Baby! You’re so crazy! You know I love you! I love you! Yeah! [screaming, laughing] [screams] Whoa! [screaming] [Dan] I promise, next year, we’ll go somewhere else. No. We’ll always have Twisted Cyclone. No, look.

I don’t know. Sometimes I guess I just feel like I’m a little… [inhales deeply] I don’t know, trapped? I know that sounds so awful. Hmm. It’s just that, um, Dan, my hu… my husband, I mean, he’s an amazing… he’s an amazing dad, you know? I guess, uh, he’s just so content being here. In Buffalo? [chuckles] Oh, my God. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to… [smacks lips] No. Say it like that. [sighs] That’s true. I mean, when we met, I wanted to travel. I wanted to see the world. [inhales deeply] But Dan’s… He’s just a total homebody, you know? He’s so focused on the family, and I do, I love that about him. He’s amazing. I just wish our lives were… bigger, you know? Just… [sighs] I get it. I’m sorry. Talk about TMI. [phone chimes] [chuckles] No, I’ve… I’ve got to catch a flight, as always. Oh. But, listen. If you ever do convince your husband to travel, I promise you, I’m better at my job than I am at kickboxing. Thank you. Thank you. [PA jingle plays] [announcer] Great news.

Me, my wife, and three kids. Three? How did that happen? Do I really need to explain the birds and the bees right now, Augie, or can we talk business? Oh, God. You’ve got some nerve calling me. McCaffrey scorched the earth looking for you. Yep. Looks like he’s found me. [Augie] How? I don’t know. Social media, I guess. You idiot. [sighs] I had to leave my life behind. Now I’m stuck in Tempe, Arizona, making fake IDs for entitled college pricks. Should I go? Oh, no. You can stay. But given you’re trying to look like you’re not in college, maybe try losing the hoodie? [mutters indistinctly] Look, I’ll pay you a half a million in cash. And you get Doris a condo in one of those retirement places. You know, the ones with the golf carts, the wine and cheese happy hour, mah-jongg at six o’clock? Leave my mom out of this. Oh, she’ll love it. I can sell you out for twice that. Well, you haven’t in 18 years. Meet me in Vegas in three days. [sighs] [clicks tongue] I’ll give you a time and a place once I’m on the road. Vegas? Why Vegas? I can’t tell my wife I’m taking her on vacation to Tempe, Arizona. Vegas, I can sell. You haven’t told them? Are you mental? What, do you think it’s that easy? What am I meant to do? Sit them down and tell them the whole story over French toast? Oh, hey, kids. You know what? Pass the maple syrup. By the way, your dad was a government assassin. I’ll tell them when I’m on the road and safe. Three days, Augie. Chess club. [exhales heavily] [breathes heavily] All right, come on. [tires squeal] [school bell rings] Where’s Nina? [panting] Nina’s not the editor anymore. She quit. What? When? Three months ago. So, where is she now? I don’t know. [sighs] All right, look. I’ll give you 50 bucks for your best guess of where Nina is. I’m a journalist. I don’t give people up. 100. Try under the bleachers. [sighs] That’s what I thought. I wrote my college essay on how universities propagate systemic racism, and my mom shot it down. [scoffs] I was like, “Hello, that’s how change happens.” A',\n",
              "  'nd she goes, “No, that’s how community college happens.” [chuckles] [Dan] Nina. Dad, what are you doing here? This is a safe space. He can’t just come in here. Your dad’s hot. Okay, Kelly. That’s gross. [chuckles] You’re meant to be in an editorial meeting. Yeah, I am. I… I was. I… You quit three months ago. How could you do that? You worked so hard to become editor. [scoffs] You don’t even read my stuff. Of course I do. I always do. Yeah. Bullshit. You know what? I don’t have time for this. Where’s the chess club? We need to find your brother. Can’t you tell me what’s going on? Nothing. I… I have a surprise for the family, okay? What’s the surprise? Where is the chess club? [sighs] It’s in the math building. Thank you, Kelly. [sighs] Dad, wait. What now? [sighs] He’s not there. Stay in the car. Oh, no. Forget it. I am not missing this. Missing what? Nothing. [grunts] [Kyle] Go, go, go, go, go. Shit. [Dan] Are you Samir? Yeah. I’m Kyle’s dad. Is he here? [cans clatter] What happened to chess club? Um… [stammers] It was canceled today. Right… Right, Samir? You don’t pay me to lie. You pay him? No, I… [stammers] [stammers] Um, you don’t need to… It’s… I… I can explain. [Dan] Get in the car. I… [sighs] Get in the car. [Dan] Let’s go now. [chuckles] [Kyle] Traitor. [Nina] So, what’s the big surprise? We’re going on a trip. Oh, I actually have plans this weekend, so I… You’re very grounded, both of you. [sighs] [sighs] Look, we’re going up there to get your mom. You two are gonna show her nothing but excitement for this trip, or I’m gonna tell her that you’ve been lying to us, and you know how that’s gonna go down. Where are we even going? [mother] Vegas? We’re going to Las Vegas today? Well, you said you wanted… Now? To be more spontaneous. I heard you. And Jorge said I could take a few days off. Is Jorge the one that does… [Kyle grunting] hydromassages on Tuesdays? No, Mrs. Kessler. Jorge is Dan’s boss. Is Dan giving me a hydromassage? No, Mrs. Kessler. There’s no massages today. No. The kids have a long weekend, and they’re pumped. Right, guys? Guys, tell your mom how pumped you are for this trip. Whoo! Yes! Oh, so pumped. Dan, we can’t just up and go to Vegas. I mean… And why Vegas? I know it’s not Europe, but there’s a Venice and an Eiffel Tower. You know what? I bet you we can get last-minute Adele tickets. You love Adele. [sighs deeply] You love Adele. Of course I love Adele. Who doesn’t love Adele? I love Adele. Everybody loves Adele. She’s got the voice of a freaking angel. Come on, Jess. What is holding us back? Who are you? I mean, I don’t even recognize you. [chuckles] Well, you’re gonna love him. He’s crazy in bed. Oh. Oh. [gasps] Ooh. Are you sure it’s not Tuesday? You deserve a break. And I think this could be really good for us as a family. And we’re driving there? Well, nothing brings a family together like a road trip. But we gotta go now. [stammers] Before the traffic gets bad. And Mrs. Kessler, I’m so sorry. You keep working on those deltoids, okay? Thanks, Jorge. What about our stuff? I mean, I need to pack, the baby. It’s… Oh, no, no, no. I got all the basics packed already. Yeah. When we get there, we’re gonna use the money that we saved on flights to go all Pretty Woman in those fancy hotel boutiques… [sighs] …that smell like leather and patchouli. Stop. And guess who’s got no budget? You get whatever you want. [exhales heavily] [sighs deeply] Okay. Oh, this is totally crazy. Dan, this is crazy. I know. It’s crazy. Oh, my God. We’re gonna get crazy. We’re going to Vegas! [Jess] Do we have snacks? [Dan] Let’s just get out there on the road, and then we can make a stop and… I think I’m gonna take a shortcut. Save us a little bit of time. [Jess] What? Go, go, go! Whoa. Shit. It’s a shortcut. You never take Elmwood? Shit. [giggles] [Dan] All right. We’re off. [Max babbling] Hey, Maxie. First road trip. Yeah. [chuckles] Max, you excited? Five hours on a plane, or 33 hours in a car? I choose 33 hours. [babbles] [Jess] Da! Honey, you remembered my boots! Yeah. Baby! I can’t believe that. [Jess] Whoa. Jesus. Oh, my God. Jesus. Dad. Easy there, lead-foot. Sorry about that. Think a squirrel or something jumped out in front of me. [babbles] [tires squealing] Oh, my God. Where on earth are you taking us? What? Oh, no. This is a shortcut, honey. You never take it? Shit. He’s tracking us. [Jess] Huh? Oh, nothing. Nothing, honey. [laptop beeping] Uh, you know what? Actually, I… I gotta… [sighs] stop and check something at work real quick. [remote beeps] Is that Hal? [Dan] Yeah. He’s got a new mustache. You work with that guy? [Dan] It will just be a second. I think there’s a service area to the right. All right. If you guys just give me a second, I’ll be right there. Dad, what the hell? Language, Nina. Dan, what the hell? Oh, well, we’re driving 2,000 miles. We’ve gotta change the oil, check the coolant, pop a little extra air in the tires. I’d hate to be halfway across the desert and wish we’d checked that coolant, right? Can we not be in the car for it? Okay, he’s stopped. He’s right ahead of us. [tools whirring] [grunts] [tracker] He should be here. [sighs] Hey, guys. Just, uh, ha… hang in there for a minute. [Jess] Dan? [Kyle] Mom, when we’re in Vegas, can I go to HyperX? No, you’re not going to a strip club. It’s not a strip club. Why are you laughing? You’re not gambling, Nina. [chuckles] Do you have a fake ID? I… I’m not… I’m not being… No. Dan! [pop music playing] [Dan] Hey, Hal. Nice wheels. She just come in? Yeah. I was thinking about opening her up a little bit. Oh, man. I tell you what. She wants to go fast. Cars are like chicks, man. Yes! Right. Get her on the freeway. You open her up. And you get a ticket, it’s on me. Oh, I got him. He’s on the move. He’s heading west. Hey, guys. Yes? [Dan] We’re ready. Are we going to Vegas, or are we just gonna live up here? We’re on our way, honey. [chuckles] [groans] [“Ready Set Go” playing] Honey, aren’t your feet cold? I don’t care. I am on vacation. What are you doing? [chuckles] I’m posting about our trip. Look, do we really need to be posting and tweeting and TikToking? In my day, road trips were all about interaction. No, Dad. Please. I can’t deal with a dad lecture right now. You literally don’t even know how to text, so your opinion doesn’t count. I’m serious. This should be a device-free vacation, okay? Give them up, now. Wh… What? [Dan] Seriously. [Jess] What? Give it up. Now. Jess, a little help? Okay, you heard him. Hand ’em over. Yours too. All right. Mine too. All of us, okay? Solidarity! Bye! [all] No! [gasps] [giggling] [Jess shouting] [Nina] No, no, no. Dad. No way you just did that. What? Oh, my God, Dad. I’ve just freed our family from the shackles of technology with a flick of my wrist. Just like that. [Kyle] Stop the car. And trust me, it’s gonna bring us all closer together. Just you wait. You’ve lost your mind. [Jess] Oh, my God. Whatever. I’ll just buy myself a new one. What, like you buy your friends? Look, Samir is a business associate. Oh, yeah. Look. At least they’re talking. [Nina] Do you wanna tell Mom and Dad about all your business endeavors? I don’t give a… I’ve got a question for you, Mr. Spontaneous. Without our phones, how are we gonna know where we’re going? If this is a joke, it’s not funny. It’s not a joke. We’re going on a family road trip. We need m',\n",

Through the forcible removal of technology. Look, I need travel help. Isn’t this what you do? [sighs] Not for a long time. What’s, uh… What’s your destination? Uh, Las Vegas. [sighs] I’m also going to need help with some reservations, if that’s not too much of an inconvenience for you. Okay. Ah, okay. Here you go. All right. [coughing] I’m gonna need a credit card. You know what? Here’s my membership card. I think you’ll see I’ve got a few rewards points there. [chuckles] That’s not really how it works. It’s like a whole thing. Oh, I get it. Maybe with all those points, I don’t even need a credit card. [“Ice Ice Baby” playing] What do you think, Levon? Are we good? How many points do we have?

Hey, his kid’s a gamer called Kyllboi. He’s pretty good. [boss] Get eyes on the road, and find that minivan. You got it, boss. Be tough for him to switch cars without tipping off the family. What makes you think they don’t know? They’re still with him. Look at you. You’re in withdrawal. Can you really not go, like, one day without blowing people’s brains out? I have a brand to manage. A desensitized cog in the violence-obsessed capitalist machine is a brand? Oh, good. Trevor’s here. [stammers] Do you even remember what your own personality is like? No. You used to be cool. Do I know you? [stammers] I don’t think so. Well, yeah. I’ve seen you on Twitch. You’re the guy who took down Synapse live on his own stream! You’re Kyllboi. Right? [stammers] You know about that? Yeah. Dude, that was badass. Um… Can I get a picture? Um, uh, sure. [chuckles] Jess… [sighs] …I don’t know how to tell you this, but when we get to Vegas, we’re not coming home. [inhales deeply] The truth is, I haven’t been completely hon… [inhales shakily] The truth is, when we met… [toilet flushes] Before I met… All right, here we go. We’ve got rooms 152 and 153. Oh, can I get, uh, four of those disposable cameras too, please? Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Keep the change. Thank you. [fan] You’re awesome, dude. For real. [chuckles] I mean, thank you. I mean, this is… this is literally the worst ever… [chuckles] [Max babbles] [Jess] I’m gonna get you. [gasps] I’m gonna get you! [Dan] All right. Here, kiddo. Go make some memories. Yeah, I’m… I don’t know, this is… It’s just a weird experience for me. [fan] That’s so cool I ran into you. Look at your brother. He’s made a friend. [fan] Uh, can you do the thing? Uh, yeah. [shutter clicking] Awesome. Thanks, Kyllboi. Thank you. Hey, what was all this about? That’s a really good question. What was that about? Yeah, and who’s Kyllboi? [Kyle] Um… [Nina] You know, that sounds familiar. I feel like I know who that is. That’s… [stammers] [stammers] No one. It’s nothing. Oh, my God. It’s not important. He’s Kyllboi. It’s his gamer tag. He never quit gaming. He thinks he’s, like, famous or something now. [Max babbles] Really? Big boy! [gasping] Da. [gasping] Da? Is she gonna post that picture? Um, prob… probably, yeah. [Jess] Hey! Did you get some rooms? Uh, no. They’re all booked. We gotta keep going. [Jess] Really? [Dan] Yeah. [babbling] [in Swedish] It’s them. Let’s go. [grunts] [FM radio host speaking, in English] [“Only Time” playing] [babbles] [screams, grunts] [chuckles] [babbles, chuckles] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [babbles] [choking] [giggling] [screams] [brakes squealing] [grunts] [screams] [thuds] [gasps] [Max chuckles] What was that? Hey, honey. Just a little bit of a pothole there. Max, did you see that? That guy was flying. [pants] [chuckling] [sighing] [groans] [gasps] Oh, my God. Jesus. Oh, my God. [babbles, laughs] [Jess] Where are we? [Dan] Iowa. [Jess] Iowa? [Dan] Yeah. Wait. Did you drive all night? Well, what can I say? I was so damn excited… [inhales sharply] …I couldn’t sleep. I mean, I kept getting second winds. More like fifth winds. And then, before you know it, bam. God. We’re in Iowa City. That’s not a real cow, honey. Okay? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Did you just say we’re in Iowa City? Oh, my God. [Dan] Yes, honey. That means we’re like… we’re literally, like, half an inch from SIU. We can… We can stop and… [groans] We are not gonna stop and see Trevor, okay? Mmm. [Nina] Actually, I meant that I wanted to see campus, but whatever. Oh. Right. ‘Cause you’re really interested in seeing the facilities. Yeah. Actually, I am. Are you serious? Are we gonna argue about this? About you following a boy to college? I’m not following a boy to col… Guys. [Jess] You’re gonna go for three months… Guys. It’s the college that I want to go to. Obviously, I would want to go see the campus. [Jess] Why do you wanna go? [Nina] We’re so far from home. This place is gorgeous. How could you not want me to come here? [scoffs, chuckles] I cannot believe that you are encouraging this. Look, it wouldn’t hurt for us to be off the road for a bit. Besides, I mean, maybe if we want her to listen to us, we gotta start listening to her more. Let her look around. It’s safe, nice. Mmm. And besides, it’ll… it’ll give us a chance to talk. [marching band playing music] Okay. You wanna find out what college life is really about? Hmm? Follow me. [crowd cheering, whistling] Ah! This takes me back. It’s like a toxic masculinity convention. [groans] It’s called school spirit, Nina. Yeah, okay. You’re not the one who’s gonna get flipped over in a porta-potty. [chuckles] Well, it’s pretty festive. Do you like it? Yeah. It’s cool. Yes. Hey, sexy. You want me to show you how to do a keg stand? Hmm. Oh, ew. Sorry. I didn’t realize you were… a mom. [chuckles] Nina. Do you mind? Okay. Here you go. [Dan stammers] Yep. [chuckling] Oh, my God. Yo! Come through. She’s gonna do it. Mom. Mom. Mom! [cheering] Mom! I can’t… [Jess] Mm-mmm. [cheering] [chuckles] Beer me! [student 2] Come on! Yeah! Chug! Chug! Chug! [students whistling, clamoring] Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! [cheering] Whoo! Whoo! [students cheering] [chuckles] Don’t you ever try anything like that. [Nina] Mom, that was… that was awesome, actually. I… [chuckles, stammers] “Beer me”? [chuckles] Mmm. Let’s get, uh, out of here before I get too competitive and start kicking ass at beer pong. Oh, my God. I wonder what that looks like. [tour guide] I hope you all enjoyed seeing the library. First time for me too. [laughs] Hey, guys. Look. There’s a tou',\n",
              "  'r. [tour guide] And you know… Let’s slip in the back and pretend like we were a part of the group all along. Do we have to? [Dan] Yeah. We’re here to support your sister. If you’re questioning that, you get to strap on Max. Let’s go. Next up, we’ll head on over to visit our state-of-the-art athletic facilities. [Nina] I’m sorry that I ratted you out. It’s just, it drives me crazy that you get away with so much, and I get yelled at constantly just because you guys don’t get Trevor. [stammers] We get Trevor. We don’t like Trevor. Why? Ever since you’ve been dating him, you’ve been like a completely different person. I liked you better before. Plus, he… he treats you like shit. You deserve more. Is that… Is that, like, genuine concern for my feelings? No. God, no. Gross. [laughs] I wonder what’s going on in your mind. [laughs] It’s just… I don’t know. Another blast from the past. Oh. You think you can still do it? No. Not unless I wanted to end up in the hospital. It’s just… [inhales sharply] It’s funny to think how different my life would be if I hadn’t torn my ACL. Well, do you want it to be different? No. God, no. It’s just… [inhales sharply] You know, it’s just strange. You’ve never even met that version of me. You just know Jessica, the physical therapist. Well, I love every version of you. Yeah? Yeah. Especially that keg stand one. It was so freaking hot. [laughs] Yeah? Oh, my God. Did you ever have sex on the pole-vault mat? [gasps] Uh… Don’t answer that. Oh, my. [chuckles] God. You have been acting so weird this whole trip. But I gotta tell you, I’m kind of into spontaneous Dan. Well, you know, Jess. I mean, we all have different versions of ourselves. And sometimes, you just… Yeah. That guy with the gold chain. Um… He wasn’t with the group before. Okay. What’s he doing? [stammers] [Gold Chain speaks German] Well, they grow up fast, huh? Which one is yours? My daughter is back in Stuttgart. I look at school for her. Wow. That’s a hike. [Gold Chain] I have business here. [tour guide] Chemistry, astronomy, astrophysics… Hey, you mentioned having business in Iowa. What business would that be? Corn. Yeah? That’s what’s in the case? [in German] Of course. [in English] Oh. Ladies. [group member] Thanks. After you. No, I insist. Dan? Oh. Hey, honey. Coming? Yeah. I’m just getting to know this fella here. All the way from Stuttgart, Germany. Oh. You know, I had a pen pal from Stuttgart back in high school. I even learned a little German. [in German] Nobody needs to know. If you want to speak about what’s in the case, it will stay between us. [laughing, in English] What did you just say? “Where’s the discotheque?” [laughs] Right. Okay. [laughs] Don’t worry, honey. We’ll catch up, okay? [Jess] All right, honey. [in German] Goodbye, my love. [laughs] [in English] Fine. You wanna dance. Let’s see what’s in the case. What the hell is that? Heirloom corn. I thought I made this clear. So, you’re just German? [in German] Yes, exactly. [in English] Oh, shit. [grunts] [grunts] [both grunting] [grunts] [groans] Biology labs are over there. Where’s Dad? [tour guide] Physics labs are down there. He’s talking to some German guy. We have our chemistry labs right here. [grunts] [groans] [blinds clatter] Never a dull moment in the labs. [laughs] Moving on. Let me show you the biggest Van de Graaff generator in the Midwest. [Jess] Mmm. [Dan groans] [pants] [grunts, groans] [groans] [groaning] [screams] [grunting, groaning] [breathes heavily] [tour guide] So, I hope you’ve all enjoyed this tour of our wonderful campus. I know I have. Hey. It’s getting late, huh? Hey. We should probably get back on the road. Yeah. Where’s Nina? Oh. I said she could go say hi to Trevor. It felt cruel to deny her. [breathes deeply] It’s okay. She’ll be back soon. [babbles] Yeah. No. I-I’m not worried at all. [breathes shakily] Okay. [Trevor] Go away, Josh. It’s me. [laughs, stammers] Me who? Uh, Nina. [whispers] Oh. Hey. What are you doing here? [stammers] It’s, like, a really long story. But, um, can I come in? [chuckles] [stammers] You know what? Give me just one sec, and I’ll throw on some pants, and me and you can grab a matcha. [gasps] Oh, my God. [chuckles] Oh, my God. Hang on a second. Oh, my God. You’re… You’re cheating on me. [stammers] Monogamy is just a construct of our Western repressive civilization. [Nina] Oh, my God. [Trevor stammers] I thought we were on the same page on that. [Jess] All right. Honey, what happened? He’s an asshole. That’s what happened. “Monogamy is just a construct”… Who even says that? Trevor. [sighs] Oh, baby. I’m so sorry. Can we just go? Ah, that’s a great idea, honey. Let’s go. [sobbing] Hey, Beans. Look, I’m sorry. [stammers] You know, when I was your age, I… [sobs] You don’t need another dad lecture, do you? [breathing heavily] Hey, Beans. You ever hear of Kyusho Jitsu? Kyusho what? [breathes heavily] Kyusho Jitsu. It’s a 13th-century martial art that uses pressure points to inflict extreme pain without permanent damage. [stammers] How do you even know about that? Well, maybe there’s more to your old man than you thought. [inhales sharply] Nina, you gotta let go of these stereotypical… [groans, cries] [screaming] [groans, crying] [Nina] How was that for “stereotypical,” you unbearably pompous, bloviating piece of sanctimonious shit? [crying, groaning] Smile. [shutter clicks] You deserve more. [Trevor groaning] [Nina cackles] [chuckles] [Max babbles] What did you say to her? It was just a dad lecture. [groans] God. [sighs] [groans] What happened to the mirror? Huh? [Jess] The mirror. Oh. You didn’t hear that? No. Oh. It was a semi. It went flying by. The guy must have been doing a hundred. And rocks just come… [stammers] …spitting out of the tire. [Jess] Jesus. One hit there. It almost hit the windshield. [bag pops] What the… [laughing] We got him. We really got you. You were so scared. [kids laughing] So, did you, um… did you tell Mom that I quit the paper? No. Did you want me to? I was kidding. [laughs] No. I… I… I was just kind of thinking about maybe getting my position back. Yeah? That’s cool. [stammers] Only do it if you want to. I gotta tell you, Beans. You’ve got a hell of a voice, and it deserves to be heard. Hey. No BS. All right? I’m serious. That piece you wrote about pervasive corruption in the Board of Education… [inhales sharply] My God. I got chills. [sighs] [stammers] You actually read that? Of course I did. Come on. I’m your biggest fan, Beans. Always have been, and I always will be. And so is your mom. And so are your brothers. Max just hasn’t told you yet. Oh, a smile. Wow. Holy shit. Oh, my God. [laughs] No, I didn’t. That was… No. [Dan chuckles] I mean it. I’m proud of you. Thanks. Mmm. Max is fed and settled in the kids’ room. I am so ready for a real bed. What? Nothing. Ooh. Ooh. Hey now. Hey. You wanna lose that? Mmm. Mmm. Oh. Wait. [breathes heavily] It’s not Thursday. [breathes heavily] Mmm. [moans] Mmm. Okay. [grunts] [moans, breathing heavily] Fuck. [moans, sighs] Mmm. [breathing heavily] [moaning] [sighs] [sighs] Wow. [groans] What was that? [chuckles] Oh, that felt like… That felt… [sighs] That was long overdue. That was… [whimpers, laughs] That’s what that was. That felt, uh… Mmm. [kisses] [sighs] That felt different. Different good, I hope. Different like… I was cheating on Dan with other Dan. Whoa! That differen',\n",
              "  't. Oh. Mmm. [laughs] No. I mean… No. It was… Don’t get me wrong. That was so hot. That was like… What got into you? I don’t know. Maybe it’s being away, or… maybe it was seeing you upside-down on that keg shouting, “Beer me!” [laughs] Is this what you used to be like? Other Dan. Did you change because of me? No. Look, I changed because I didn’t like who I was back then. Then I met you. Then I became a dad. [inhales sharply] And for the first time in a long time, I felt good. I just took it too far. I got too comfortable. Too safe. Mmm. And that probably came across as boring… Well… and maybe neglectful… for what it’s worth… and I’ll never do that again. I really like both Dans. Do you? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, I’m already here, so… Mmm. How convenient. [laughs] Yeah. [phone ringing] Hello? [Dan] Augie? We’re on track tonight. Aria bar, 6:00 p.m. Do you have everything? Some of my finest work. If I may say so. What, better than that passport that got me cavity searched in Bogotá? You’re never gonna let me forget that, are you? Yeah, sure. The day I forget the snap of that latex glove. Have you told them yet? I’m working on it, all right? It’s not exactly easy to work into a conversation. You know, they might think that something is up when they have to change their name and leave the country. What are you waiting for? I said I’m working on it, Augie. All right? Give me a break. [bells on door jingling] Look, Jess. [exhales deeply] There’s something that I need to tell you. About the other Dan. [sighs] The Dan I was before we met. Dad? Who you talking to? Nobody. Sit down. Girls aren’t ready yet. So, Kyllboi, huh? Hmm. Why didn’t you tell us? [stammers] I knew you’d never get it, that you’d just freak out and ban me for even longer. Here you go. I wasn’t trying to punish you, you know. We just wanted you to have other interests. Make some friends. Be a little bit more normal. I… I have friends. Okay? Thousands of them. People like me when I’m Kyllboi, okay? I… I like me. But when I’m Kyle, I-I’m too shy to talk to girls. You know, I’m… I’m… I’m not good enough to make the baseball team. I-I’m a nobody. [chuckles] But when I’m Kyllboi, I’m good, Dad. Like… Like pro-level good. [stammers] Look, okay. I… I know you think it’s all just a waste of time, but it takes brains and… and reflexes. Th… The Air Force recruits gamers. Yeah. Maybe that’s what I’m afraid of. [stammers] Let me show you. Show me what? [Kyle] What I can do. Laser tag? [stammers] You can’t be serious. Single combat, okay? I-I-If I win, I get to start gaming again. If you win, the ban remains. What, I don’t get anything? [stammers] Okay, fine. What do you want? A catch. Like we used to. You and me in the backyard, throwing a ball every day for six months. [laughs] Dad, I’m… I’m not 12. Well, you’re gonna smoke me anyway. Right, Mr. Brains and Reflexes? Fine. Good luck. You are so screwed. [sighs] Let’s go. [employee] You’re green. You’re blue. Once you’re hit, you’re out for five seconds. First one to three kills, wins. You just pull the trigger? [automated voice] Death match. Prepare yourself. Three, two, one, fight. Go easy on me, buddy. Dad. Come on. I’ll give you a free one, yeah? All right. [zapping] [automated voice] First blood. [Dan] Oh, I got lucky there. All right. That’s one. [zapping] How are you doing this? No, no, no. No, don’t… [sighs] Hey, Kyllboi. I thought you wanted to play laser tag, not hide-and-seek. [zapping] Oh, you sneaky little shit. [chuckles] You’re getting pretty good at this, Kyle. [zapping] [sighs] Well, at least I don’t need a DNA test. [automated voice] Sudden death. [zapping] [automated voice] Game over. [Dan] Kyle, come on. Don’t be mad. You conned me. You’re a… a laser tag savant. No. I was a kid in the ’80s. Yeah, like there were lasers back then. Come on, pal. You were good in there. You adapted quickly. You got creative. You almost had me. And I gotta admit, I really enjoyed doing that with you. I mean, it meant a lot to me. Are we good? Come on. Give me some love. Real love. Yeah. [laughs] Not bad for an old man, huh? Uh, yeah. For sure. Hey. What do you say, mamacita? Home stretch. You ready? [Jess] Vegas! [Nina] Are you ready?

[chuckles] This is all ours? Oh, my God. [Dan] Oh, wow. “Enjoy the suite for which every possible promotion has been applied. You have a 7:00 p.m. reservation at La Maison D’Or. Thank you for being exceptional members. Levon.” How nice. [gasps] What? Nina? [Nina] Yep. You have to look at this tub. I gotta run downstairs for a sec. Don’t let them raid the minibar, okay? [Jess chuckles] [Nina laughs] That is not mini. [laughs] [laughs] Oh, my God. [inhales sharply, sighs] Oh, my God. Yes! Hey. Look at you, playing the family man. I’m not playing. This is my life. Hmm. You see any sign of trouble on your way in? Uh-uh. Me neither. I mean, I messed up, stopping in Iowa, but I think we’re in the clear. Well, then enjoy your last night as Dan Morgan, my friend. I’ve got you on a flight to Vancouver in the morning under your new identities. Hey. You’re a lifesaver, Augs. Thank you. Try to get out of Vegas with some of it, huh? I promise nothing. [laughs] How did the family take the news? I haven’t told them yet. I’m telling Jess at dinner. I suggest a Japanese restaurant. Why? No knives. [laughs] [sighs] [sighs] Wow. You look incredible. [chuckles] [laughs] I know. Wow! What a lucky guy I am. [sighs] Wow! Come on. [Jess sighs] Hey. All right. You two are on Max. You’re not to leave this suite under any circumstance. There’s food in the supersized minibar. You do not open that door for anyone. You got it? [Kyle] Got it. [Dan] What about you, Maxie? [babbles] [Jess] You got it? [inhales sharply] [Dan] Yeah? All right. Have fun. Be good. [Jess giggles] [door opens, closes] Screw that, right? Oh, yeah. [inhales deeply] Ready? [babbles] Let’s go. Yeah. [laughs] [sighs] [vocalizes] Excited. [“Chaise Longue” playing] [chuckles, gasps] Wow. Hey, let’s go to HyperX. I wanna see the esports arena. No way. No, no. I’m not spending my time in an arena full of Kyles. I’m not going. Sucks to suck. Me and Max are going. Ugh. [laughs] [Kyle] Hello, Elvis. [Elvis impersonator] Uh-huh. [laughs] [no audible dialogue] [chuckles] Bye. Bye. [Nina] Whoo! All right. I think it’s just down here. You’re gonna love it. I already hate it. [spectators cheering, whistling] [announcer] Welcome to the HyperX Arena. Five minutes until our final round. This is sick. Smells like your room on steroids. Thanks. That’s Ren. Hi. Sorry. Uh, big fan. [chuckles] Thanks. Wait. You’re, um… Kyllboi. Yeah. I’ve seen your streams. Thanks. [laughs] Hey. Do you wanna meet Valkyrae and the others? [chuckles] Hell yeah. Okay. I have a gift for you. [groans] Okay. Take him. [sighing] Thank you very much. [breathes deeply] Mmm. [breathes deeply] To us. Yeah. [inhales sharply] I ca',\n",
              "  'n’t believe we actually did it. We’re here. Yep. We’re here. [sighs] Look, Jess… Mmm. There’s something I need to tell you. Hang on. Come here. What? Oh, my God. [chuckles] Mmm. Thank you. You don’t have to thank me. [stammers] Sorry. I interrupted. No, no, it’s okay. It’s just… The reason that we came on this trip… [speaks French] [gasps] [inhales sharply] What I was saying was… [server, in French] Would you like some pepper? I don’t want pepper. I want to be alone with my wife. [in English] Oh. I don’t actually speak French. They just teach us enough to sound fancy. [speaking French] [stammers] I’ll give you a minute. You speak French too? I… I… I took some French back in the day. It’s literally kind of weird that you’ve never mentioned to me that you speak two foreign languages. [sighs] How good are you? [in French] I don’t know, it has been a while. I have traveled around the world. Despite that, it’s hard to tell you the truth. I’m afraid to break your heart. I don’t know if you will still love me… once you know who I truly am. I’m sorry that you’re being pulled into this… but I swear on my life… that I’ll never let any person… hurt you or the kids. [in English] That was crazy sexy. Why does everything sound so much better in French? Well, it’s an innately melodic language. At some point, you and I are gonna have to talk about why you never told me you can do that. I mean, it’s crazy you didn’t tell me. [stammers] We should also… [chuckles] …talk about how insane you’ve been acting ever since you showed up and whisked us off to Vegas. But right now… right now, I just wanna be here with you. I wanna be eating this amazing food, and drinking this champagne we can’t afford, and enjoying each other’s company, and just maybe… showing that ridiculous hotel suite some moves it has never seen before. I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a pretty perfect night. [Valkyrae] What rank are you? Um… Uh, Ascendant 3. Damn. Really? That’s better than him. [stammers] That’s incredible. [laughs] Oh, my. How long you been playing for? Um, I mean, since the game came out. It’s cool your brother’s Kyllboi. [scoffs] Is it? Yeah. He’s the real deal. Um, so, is this your… [scoffs] No. Oh, God. No. No, no, no. I found him. Just over there. Over there? Yeah. [laughs] Just hanging out? It’s time for the finals. [crowd cheering, clapping] Team Valkyrae and Team iiTzTimmy onto the stage! [chuckles] Hey, let’s go. Use Kyllboi. Are you up for it? [laughs] The… The finals? Yeah, this is one of those moments, man. Are you in or out? [stammers, laughs] In. Let’s go. Yeah. Okay. [chuckles] Don’t be nervous. It’ll be a piece of cake. [laughs] [Kyle] Thanks. Hey, that was kind of cool of you. [grunts] Not really. They’re gonna get destroyed. [laughs] [chuckles] What’s up, everyone? Take a seat, Kyllboi, right next to me. Whoo! [screaming] [cheering] [crowd cheering] Do you have ammo? I’m gonna try and block us off real quick. Above here. Let’s go. Good job. Okay. Next. [roulette dealer] No more bets. Oh, shoot! [groans] [stammers] I’m gonna call the kids. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [crowd cheering] [Valkyrae] Check B Main right now. Nice shot. Here’s the last one. [Valkyrae] He satcheled in. Are you serious? What was that? Nice! [Kyle] Whoo! That was so sick! [phone ringing] Hey. Hey. Hey, the kids aren’t answering. You wanna… You wanna head back up? Yeah. Let’s… Let’s do it. Okay. Whoa, Jess. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Mmm. [sighs] They okay? They’re good. [sighs] [sighs] [exhales sharply] Look, I’m so sorry we cut the night short. I didn’t… Who says we did, huh? [breathes deeply] Oof. Give me 30 seconds to freshen up, and then meet me in bed. Okay. [sighs, breathes heavily] Okay. Mood. [gasps] [“I Like It” playing] Love mist. Uh, Jess! [gunfire] [grunts] Dan? [muffled scream] [grunts] [groaning, whimpering] Oh. Oh, my God. There he is. [pants] Dan? I’ve been looking for you. Dan. [breathing heavily] Dan. [breathing heavily] Easy, Coogan. [whimpers] You got me. You win. [breathes heavily] Just let her go. She doesn’t know anything. Well, I’d say she does now, Sean. [whimpers] Yeah. So here’s how this is gonna go. First, I’m gonna kill you. And then I’m gonna kill her. And then I’m gonna have my associate at HyperX kill your kids. [breathing heavily, whimpering] [Coogan] How’s that sound? I can explain. [breathing heavily, gasping] [retches] Oh, that’s normal, honey. Everybody barfs their first time. [breathing heavily] Give me one second. [Jess exhales sharply] What? [sighs] Oh, my God. [breathes heavily] Jess, wait. Where are you going? HyperX. [Dan sighs] [Jess breathes heavily] So, do you… do you want me to talk, or do you have things to say? Do I have things to say? Right. Sorry. I have eyeball on me, Sean. Fucking eyeball. [breathes shakily] Jess. Shut up. Shut up! I don’t wanna hear it. I don’t even wanna look at you. I just wanna find my kids, who don’t have their goddamn phones because you threw them away! [crowd cheering] Kyllboi, it’s just you and me. Take this guy. Breach. Watch out! I have a rez. [Kyle] Okay. Oh, no. [iiTzTimmy gamer] Oh! Shit on! Oh, my God. It’s all on you, man. To the left. Nice shot. Nice. One more. Coming. [gasps] Let’s go! [Kyle] Yes! Yes! [announcer 2] We have a winner! Team Valkyrae wins! [Kyle] Yes! [announcer 2] Doesn’t get much closer than that. Kyllboi! Kyllboi! That’s right. [crowd chanting] Kyllboi! [announcer 2] Give it up! [Dan] It’s Kyllboi. Who’s Kyllboi? Kyllboi! Kyle? Oh, shit. Kyle! Hey! [Dan] Where’s your brother? That’s a funny story. He’s literally right there. No. Your other brother. Okay, yeah. He’s fine. He’s good. He’s with Ren. [Jess, Dan] What? [Nina] Excuse me. [babbling] See? See? He’s fine. Max is great. Heya. Hey. Okay. [mouthing words] Call me. Listen. I… I… I know you guys are mad… [stammers] Listen, that… that’s me they’re cheering for. [Jess] What were you thinking? [Nina] Well, Max is fine. Okay, look. Guys, we don’t have time for this, okay? We need to get out of this city. [Nina blows raspberry] Overreact much? Wait, wait. [stammers] Why do we have to leave? Because. [sighs] Jess, tell them, please. This is all on you. We have to leave because my former coworkers are trying to kill us. What? From Planet Car Deals? [chuckles] I’m not kidding around. Ask Max. Huh? Before I met your mom, I was a covert assassin. I escaped that life, and now they’ve found us. [laughing] Dad, you are, like, the biggest wimp on the planet. [gun cocks] [gasps] Thank you. Move. Go! Now! [gunshots] [shrieking] [Dan] Go, go. [Jess groans] Find an exit. Find an exit. [Jess breathes heavily] [Dan] Move, guys. Come on. [Jess] Go. Go. Go, go, go, go. [Kyle] Dad? What the fuck? I’m gonna draw her fire, okay? When I do, take the kids that way. I’ll be right behind you, okay? [Jess gasps, breathes heavily] [people screaming] [yelps] [panting] Go. Jess, she’s coming. Wait here. [Jess] Okay. Okay. [Dan] Wait right here. [grunting] [thumps] [people screaming] [retches] Oh. Uh, it’s okay, honey. Everyone barfs the first time. Come on, we gotta go. Come on. Let’s go. Move, guys. Go. [Dan] My real name is Sean. My mother died when I was four. My father was prone to violence. When I turned 18, it was straight into the army. I dunno. Maybe it was his genes coming out, but I thrived. I was a Green Beret. I was a Delta. And then I was ',\n",
              "  'approached by a man named McCaffrey. Former SAS. He took my training to a whole other level and recruited me into a special program. It was a chance to do some real good. What kind of special program? We took out the worst of the worst. Terrorists, warlords, kidnappers all over the world. Ones the government couldn’t legally touch. Took out, as in… Well, how many? Twenty-six. You’ve killed 26 pe… [shushes] No. No. No, I w… I went on 26 operations. Oh, God. Thirty-nine people. That’s more! Are we including this trip? Total dead people, Dan! [Nina] Dad. Forty-three. They were all bad. You are such a hypocrite. All bad people. You took away the one thing I’m good at because there’s fake violence, and you’re a serial killer? Dad, you were working for the good guys, right? McCaffrey was a father figure. I trusted him, but I was naive. I mean, it started out legit. But he got greedy and began farming us out as mercenaries to the highest bidder. [sighs] And as soon as I found out, I left. All right? I fought my way out, but that meant turning against my friends, my mentor, against the only real family that I’d ever known. So they’ve been hunting you ever since. Yeah. I am such an idiot. This is why you’re so secretive, why you never wanna go anywhere. [stammers] Why… Why you’re so weird about social media. Why you’re s… you’re so anti-technology. Well, with facial recognition software, I had no choice. Plus, I really do think that social media is fundamentally disgusting and gross. [sighs] God. But now that they found us, what happens? I got it figured out. We’re good. That’s yours. And that’s yours. And that’s yours. “Molly Anderson”? At least you got a real name. I’m Van. [stammers] I’m a… I’m a vehicle. Van? Look, we can’t go back to Buffalo, all right? Those lives are over. I’m sorry. I finally have a life, and you’re ruining it. Thanks, Dad. [Dan] Kyle, come back. Dad, no. You don’t get to tell us what to do anymore. Ever. Come… [sighs] Eighteen years of lies. I’m still the man you married. I was just something different before. Something different? You weren’t in a band or vegan, Dan. That would be something different. You were an assassin for hire. I kept the truth from you to protect you, okay? But our love was real. Real? Are you serious? What, was it so real that you couldn’t trust me with knowing how much danger we were in? What did you think? That I’d go blabbing about it on the… on the moms’ school text chain? No. I… Or were you afraid I’d leave you, knowing who you really are? [chuckles] We were just some disguise for you, just some part of your cover as a suburban schlub? What? No. No. Fuck, you must have resented us. Right? Every single day, eking out a living, wiping kids’ asses, driving a minivan. I love that minivan. I mean, all of a sudden you’re, like, what, James Bond, and now you’re what? Normal. A normal guy with a normal, wonderful, perfect life. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I mean, you were a decathlete. You should’ve medaled in Athens. Do you resent your life as a mom? Sometimes. Yes. [sighs, stammers] I don’t wanna be that guy. I wish I could believe you. I really do. But to be honest, this trip is the happiest that I have seen you in years. [chuckles] A trip in which you have killed four people. [huffs] I mean, is this really you? You’re a stranger named Sean. “Archibald Anderson.” Oh, damn it, Augie. You know, first thing in the morning, I am taking the kids and I am leaving. Jess, it’s not safe. It’s not safe with you. They’re after you, not us. And from now on, I’m making the decisions about me and the kids. [sighs] Jess. [Jess] Yeah. Hi. Uh, thanks for picking up. I know it’s late. I was wondering if you could help with some travel for my family, please. [siren wailing in distance] [door opens] Where are you going? Far from here, far from you. Where? It’s none of your business. What? Like hell it isn’t. Hey, you cannot go to the airport, you know. They’re gonna be waiting there. Well, we’re not. We’ve made other arrangements. What other arrangements? Sorry, Dan. Can’t say. It’s to protect you. Jess… [stammers] Oh, really? Come on. Don’t… Jess. Please. It’s not safe. Then handle it. Make it safe. And when you’re done with it, stay away from us. Is this for us? No, I don’t think so. Couldn’t be. Hi. Gwen. What are you doing here? I wasn’t expecting all this. I was on a layover nearby, and I thought, I’ll just come get you myself. Okay. Uh… [Gwen] Hi. You must be Molly and Van. I’m Gwen. Hi, little one. Uh, there’s breakfast on board, if you’d like it. Sure. Mm-hmm. [sighs] Thanks. Jessica, what is wrong? Are you okay? Uh… What happened? Where’s your husband? We had a fight. [Gwen] Oh, boy. Hey, maybe you can help me with my guy problems then. How about that? I’d love to. [clicks tongue] Remember that ex I told you about in Buffalo? Yeah. We were together for years. It was good. I mean, it was really good. [sucks teeth] You know when you just can’t get enough of each other physically? I thought he was the one, and then he just threw it all away. Married some other woman who was the complete opposite of me. And the worst part… she’s insufferable. Wait. You met her? Oh, I had to. He created this whole life with this woman, and I needed to see what she had that I didn’t. [stammers] What did you do? I did what I do best. I got in close, I won her trust, and then I just waited patiently for her to walk into my trap. You know, I think, um, I left something in the taxi. Hey, Molly? Yeah? You wanna bring your brother? Let’s go. We’re leaving. [babbles] I told you to stay off this op. And yet, who brought them to you in a big, fat bow? You needed me. I know Sean better than you ever will. Do whatever you want with the family. I don’t care. I just want Sean. He’s my payment for delivery. [babbles] [phone buzzes] You couldn’t let it go, could you? [sighs] You know me better than that. Look, you can have me, but I want your word that you won’t go after my family. “Go after”? You’re a little behind, buddy boy. I swear to God, if you hurt them… Come and get ’em. Somewhere public. I think you’re mistaking who holds the cards here. Be at the old Poseidon Casino north of the city in 30 minutes… alone. [sighs deeply] [breathes heavily] Come on out! Hello, old friend. He brought you in for this, huh, Spiros? He brought everybody. Follow me. [drone whirring] He’s alone. Well, well. How sweet. He could have been halfway around the world by now, and yet here he is, trading his life for the family that abandoned him. So, am I ever getting back that five grand I lent you in Morocco? I’ll tell you what. If you’re still alive in ten minutes, I’ll pay you back with interest. Oh, shame. It’s a beautiful place. They’re demolishing it in ten days. [elevator dings] [Dan] All this for me, huh? I’m flattered. How’s the family? Which one? We’re coming up. There he is. Are you okay? No hug for your old man? Why start now, Dad? [stammers] I’m sorry, what? I’m your grandfather, Kyle. O-Oh my… Oh, my God. We’re… We’re British. He didn’t tell ya? No. He left that part out of his no-more-lies speech. Well, I said he was a father figure. Not quite the same, Dan. This is good, right? He’s not gonna kill his own grandkids. Look, do whatever you want with me. Let them go. What is it you think I want, Sean? Kill me. In that spider’s nest of a heart, you actually thi',\n",
              "  'nk that I wronged you. You were my son. My legacy. I poured everything I am into you. You threw it all away. You abandoned me. You broke my heart. So, yeah. I wanted you dead. But then something happened over these past few days. You wasted every single guy I sent at you. Every goddamn one. You are every bit the killer I taught you to be. No. It’s not who I am anymore. Bullshit. Tell me you didn’t feel more alive the past three days than you have done in years. [sighs] [McCaffrey] And as you smoked each of my men, I felt something that I haven’t felt in a very long time. Pride in my son. What? So, what is this? Now you don’t wanna kill me? What the hell do you want? I want you back. What? Things were never as good after you left. For any of us. So, I want my son back, working by my side in the family business. You’re… You’re not seriously considering this, are you, Dad? Quiet, Kyle. Everybody wins. You come back where you belong. Be who you were born to be. Jess and the kids go safely back to Buffalo. It’s what they want anyway. Sure beats the shit out of selling cars. But no contact. Can’t have you going soft on me again. I’m their father. There’s no way this is gonna happen. I’m sorry to hear that. Start with the wife. [gun cocks] Wait, no! I… [McCaffrey] There’s no third option! Either it all ends here and now, or you give your family exactly what they want and then some! I’ll do it. [babbling] Okay. Spiros, see the family to the airport with our blessing. [Jess sighs] [breathes heavily] [sobbing] [breathes heavily] Dad. [babbles] [whimpering] Dad, please. [sobs] I love you. I’ll always love you. Look, we can’t just abandon Dad. What am I supposed to do? It’s my job to keep you safe. I’m a mom. Okay, then… then be the mom that lifts the car. What? You know, the… the mom. She… She has the baby, and she lifts the car. Yeah. You know. Car mom. I have no idea what you’re talking about. [sighs] It’s an urban legend, Mrs. Morgan. A baby is trapped under a car. [elevator dings] His mother gets a burst of adrenaline and lifts the car up with her bare hands. Your children are suggesting you overpower me to rescue their father. Yeah. Thank you. Exactly. I would advise against it. [stammers] Now. Duh. Your father made his choice. [sighs] I mean, do you think he wants this? It’s Dad that we’re talking about. The guy that… that took me to junior prom when Trevor didn’t show up. The guy that… that wakes us up for school with shitty raps about Wednesdays. That’s beautiful. My father never did that. I’m sorry. Can you shut up, Spiros? [elevator dings] [sighs] [Spiros] Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop. [clears throat, sighs] Children. Mom, we’re not a family without Dad. Dad needs to know that we don’t want this. I… I… I know we said we did last night, but, Mom, I… I don’t. [elevator dings] If… If he still chooses to do it, then… then so be it. But he needs to know. [sighs] I mean, he thinks that we don’t love him anymore, Mom. We can’t just let things end like that. [sniffing] Oh, Max. I haven’t changed you. We have to get this off of you before you get a rash. You forgot the diaper bag. Oh. [chuckling] [grunts] Oh, my gosh. [elevator dings] Ooh, gosh. It’s a real messy one. [groans] [Spiros groaning] [Spiros screaming] [grunts, gasps] Oh, crap. [thuds] [panting] Uh, maybe he’ll be all right. Or not. What do we do now? We’re gonna go find your dad. Give me a minute alone with him, would you? I wanna be wheels up in ten minutes. I thought if I ever saw you again, I’d kill you. But since we’re here… [moans] Better. Oh, sure. Pretend I’m not here. This isn’t gonna happen. I have a wife. You had a wife. Now you’re free. [moans] Doesn’t it feel good to be back where you belong? It’s been a long time, Gwen. [kisses] You think I forgot your little tricks? You think I forgot this? [moans] [gasps] [sighs] I knew you hadn’t changed. [sighs] You could never resist me. Hmm. [breathes heavily] [grunts] [groans] Vulcan neck pinch. Kyusho Jitsu. [gasping] Whoa. Whoa! Hey. [chuckles] I’m just the tech guy. [chuckles] I’m so sorry for this, you guys. For the ass-grabbing part or the 18-years-of-deception thing? Both. All of it. Hey. Tie him up. Yeah. You. Come on. I wanted to tell you about everything, but there was never a good time. Never a good time? When was I gonna tell you? On our first date? Our second? When you were pregnant with Nina or by our fourth? What? Do the math, Nina. Any of those times would have been a better time. You should have told me the truth, and I could have made up my own mind. You’re right. I’m sorry. I was stupid and selfish. But I was in love with you. I mean, you’ve been my whole world since the moment we met. Being your husband and their father, that’s the real me. That’s all that matters to me. All right. I swear on my life, I’ll never keep anything from you again. [sighs] [phone line rings] [beeps] Where’s Spiros? Thought they were with you. Hey, bro. Everyone I know is talking about what Kyllboi did at HyperX last night. Really? Yeah. [chuckles] Kyle. Less talking, more tying, okay? Ow. Sorry. [chuckles] No way. A Sky Raven drone? Awesome. [tracker] Just, careful with it. Hey, man. You got a great kid. Ow! Ow! I need your comms. Dude! [Dan] Hey, Kyle. Give me that. You’re not anti-technology. You’re… You’re awesome. They’re coming. What? Go up to the roof and find somewhere to hide with the kids, okay? No, you’re not going down there. [kisses] It’s the only way to end this. This is the only way we go home. We don’t have to go home. We can just go to Canada and be the Andersons. Please, Dad. It’s too late for that, Beans. No. You’re not giving yourself up to them. No. I’m getting us home. [babbling] Okay. [sighs] [Dan] I got a plan. Look, I need to be that guy one last time for us. [sighs] Dad. Th… There’s too many of ’em. Well, I have something they don’t have. Kyllboi. That’s your comms. You’re my eyes and my ears, okay? I’m counting on you. [sighs] Let’s go. Move out, Kyllboi. Hey, Kyle, you’re on the same channel as me. I want every inch of this atrium covered. [Jess breathes heavily] [sniper] Movement on the elevator! The elevator door. Now! You see a shot, you take it, because, believe me, he will. You got a shot? [sniper] Negative. I don’t see him yet. [elevator dings] [“Wheels On The Bus” playing] [assassin] He’s not here. Wait. What do ya got? Take cover! [screams] [grunting] [Kyle] Holy shit. Hey. See anybody? [grunts] [grunts] [screams] [glass shattering] He’s up there! Shit. [gunfire] Talk to me, Kyle. You’re my eyes. You’re clear on your right. Go now. [gunfire] [Kyle] Dad, man on your left. [grunting] [screams] [grunts] [Kyle] Dad, are you okay? Man ahead. [grunting] Man on your six. [panting] [Dan] Great job, Kyle. [Kyle] I’m on it, Dad. [Dan] Talk to me, Kyle. They’ve got the drone. [Kyle] Look out. Behind the curtain. [grunts] Come on, Dad. Get him. [grunts, shouts] [grunting] [pants] Oh. You again. They mopped your ass up off aisle three, huh? [babbles] Gonna need that mop again. [babbles] [grunting] Gwen, where the hell are you? Gwen? Gwen? McCaffrey? What’s going on? Kid’s got the drone. Find him. Call it off, Dad! [stammers] Hold your fire! Change your mind, Sean? No. But here’s your chance to. Call it off now. You don’t have it in you to kill your own flesh and blood. I, on the other hand, do have it in me. Let him have it! [',\n",

Don’t make a sound. Do not leave Max, whatever happens. [breathes heavily] [breathing heavily] [elevator dings] [gasps] [empty gun chamber clicks] [Gwen] Jessica. Is that you? [chuckling] [sighs] Talk to me, Kyle. [pants] [Kyle] Gwen’s… Gwen’s up here. I know the sound of an empty gun when I hear one, sweetie. So why don’t we make this real easy, shall we? [breathes shakily] Unless you think you can take me. I th… I think… I think Mom’s gonna f-fight her. [grunting, gasps] [panting] [grunting] [grunts, panting] [laughs] You think you can beat me because you took some kickboxing classes at the Y and wear Lululemon? Ooh, no. [grunting, panting] Oh. [grunts] Ooh. Learn that in class? [panting] Yeah. You know I do this for a living, right? While you were popping out brats and clipping coupons, I was assassinating dictators. So, why don’t you go back to the PTA? ‘Cause you’re a joke. [panting, grunts] [Dan] Kyle, what do you see? All right, there’s nine guys left. Four to your right, five ahead of you. [both grunting] [grunts] Whoa. [chuckles] [Dan] I’m out of ammo, Kyle. Find cover, Dad. A man coming. Get over the low wall. Now. [grunts] [sighs] Kyle, could have mentioned that table, buddy. [Kyle] Sorry. [grunting, panting] [whimpers, panting] [screams] Take out the one on the left now. [grunting, panting] Dad, hold on. We gotta move. [Jess grunting] [panting] [groaning] [Dan] Kyle. That guy below, chase him through the foyer. Okay, I’m going. I’m chasing him. [Dan] Keep him coming. He’s coming right at me. [both grunt] [grunting, panting] Take Max. I gotta go help Mom. [Dan] Talk to me, Kyle. [Kyle] Two left, including granddad. Man on your right! [grunting, panting] [McCaffrey] Wouldn’t go that way if I were you, Sean. Dad, Mom’s hurt. We’re… We’re in big trouble. [blows raspberry] Ah. Little brats. [grunting] [grunts] I was wrong about you, Sean. You’re no use to me. Family have made you weak. You can’t even focus on the fight you’re in because of them. [Dan grunting] [gasps] Hi. Going somewhere? Oh, don’t worry about her. She’s great. [groaning] You know, that move you pulled back there, little one? That was a very bad idea. Look. For what it’s worth, killing minors is the least favorite part of my job. Now, who’s first? We’re not done! [grunts] Mom. No, Mom! [screaming] [grunting] [empty gun chamber clicks] [pants] Bang.

[chuckles] [both grunting] [Dan grunts] [breathes heavily] Far as I’m concerned, this is an act of mercy. I’m saving you 20 more years of selling used cars. Certified pre-owned. [chuckles] Goodbye, Sean. [sighs] [Nina] Grandpa! Wait! [pants] [breathes heavily] I know you think that we probably hate you for everything that’s happened these past few days, and… and maybe we should. But I’ve learned that family is the most important thing in the entire world. And when I… when I look at you, I don’t just see a cold-blooded killer. I see my grandpa. [babbles] And maybe… maybe there’s a way for us to move forward… as a family. Kid, if you think this little speech is gonna win me over… [sighs] Honestly… I was just hoping it would buy him enough time to do this. [grunting] [sighs] [giggles] [Jess] Oh, baby. Baby. [breathes heavily] [Nina] Dad. Hey. [pants] Thank you. [chuckling] Hi! [coos, giggles] Wow! [sirens wailing] [newscaster] Good afternoon, and welcome to the news at noon. While details are continuing to emerge about a covert paramilitary group… Thanks. Responsible for high-profile assassinations reportedly spanning decades, this bombshell story was broken by a high school newspaper reporter, Nina Morgan. [grunting] [gun clicks] And you’re dead. That’s bullshit. You said there’d be two hostiles. I lied. But, Sam, that was better. Take him down harder. I didn’t wanna hurt the guy. [Dan] No, he’ll be fine. He’s small, but he’s very strong. Hey, excuse me. Why don’t you get thrown against a truck 20 times? Because my name’s on the letterhead. Et voilà! Hey, guys. I have a family commitment. Augie, you take it from here, okay? Let’s pick up the pace! I’m gonna be gone for the next few days! I want you to remember me! [whistle blows] [Jess sighs] Hey, it’s time to go. Okay, people. I’m out. [Max giggles] [Dan] Guys, come on. We gotta beat the traffic! [Nina] Oh, come on. [Max giggles] [Nina] No, I cannot show up to school in this monstrosity. How could you do this to me?

Oh, gross. You gonna be doing that all the way to California? Yes. All the way. Yeah. Absolutely. [Nina] Come on. [Dan] Yeah. [Kyle] I’m going. Here, scooch, scooch. And I will take those.
