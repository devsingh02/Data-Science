Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We\\u2019re here. This is crazy. It\\u2019s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don\\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I\\u2019m arguing with. And the reason it\\u2019s a source of tension is that I\\u2019m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, \\u201cWell, you don\\u2019t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, I think it\\u2019s insane, you know, for anyone.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\nAnd I said, \\u201cWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.\\u201d You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That\\u2019s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That\\u2019s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy\\u2019s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I\\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we\\u2019re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, \\u201cWell, we like sex just as much as you do.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cSure, but it\\u2019s different.\\u201d And they say, \\u201cHow?\\u201d And I say, \\u201cHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?\\u201d\\nNumber three\\u2026 I\\u2019m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that\\u2019s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn\\u2019t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that\\u2019s the hopeful part. The, uh\\u2026 I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he\\u2019s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren\\u2019t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were\\u2026 we were pretty good. I mean, we weren\\u2019t like the best in the world. I\\u2019m sure there are better in Europe. But we were\\u2026 we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, \\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\\u201d And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\\u2019t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I\\u2019m at Andy\\u2019s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\\u2019re right. He says stuff like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy.\\u201d Like, even if what she\\u2019s saying isn\\u2019t that crazy, like, you\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe only eats whole wheat bagels.\\u201d He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cShe sounds crazy!\\u201d You\\u2019d be like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not even the crazy part!\\u201d You know. So I\\u2019m telling him about his argument. And he goes, \\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know. I\\u2019m right.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know I\\u2019m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.\\u201d And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I\\u2019m driving out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned! I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re familiar with this term, uh\\u2026 This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\\u2019s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh\\u2026 No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I\\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m writing my set list.\\u201d And then she goes, \\u201cI think it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine.\\u201d And then she was like, \\u201cI think it will be okay.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cWhy do you think that?\\u201d And she said, \\u201cWell, you look so nervous, I think they\\u2019ll feel sorry for you.\\u201d But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, \\u201cIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.\\u201d Normally, I\\u2019d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, \\u201cYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.\\u201d She re\\u2026 she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean\\u2026 I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I\\u2026 I\\u2019d jus\\u2026 I\\u2019d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and\\u2026 and then we weren\\u2019t. And then when we weren\\u2019t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and\\u2026 But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don\\u2019t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I\\u2019m seeing a girl, she\\u2019d think, \\u201cI\\u2019d have sex with him, maybe.\\u201d You know, and I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don\\u2019t give off a great first impression. Like, I\\u2019ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn\\u2019t\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my \\u201cA\\u201d outfit. My \\u201cB\\u201d outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I\\u2019ve reached this point in my life I don\\u2019t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I\\u2019m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like\\u2026 But I don\\u2019t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I\\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cCome on!\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re blind if you\\u2019re leaving the house like that!\\u201d And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it\\u2019s a close game \\u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I\\u2019m all riled up. I\\u2019m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNext time.\\u201d You know, that\\u2019s how I go for fried dough, \\u2019cause I have a problem. I just\\u2026 This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I\\u2019m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I\\u2019ve been going, uh, recently to a women\\u2019s exercise class. I-I\\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I\\u2019m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s going pretty well, you know. I\\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I\\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\\u2019t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I\\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they\\u2019ll have those\\u2026 The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they\\u2019ll fall, and it\\u2019s ugly \\u2019cause they\\u2019re rolling around like, \\u201cI\\u2019m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don\\u2019t even know how I got here.\\u201d But at the end of that, no matter what\\u2026 And I totally fall for it. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cthat can\\u2019t possibly be the same loser \\u201cFrom moments ago. \\u201cI mean, that\\u2019s a completely different person. \\u201cThis person has much better posture, for starters.\\u201d I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis \\u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don\\u2019t know, and, uh\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh\\u2026 Pfft. Which\\u2026 yeah, I don\\u2019t know if that was the best idea \\u2019cause, uh, we\\u2019re heading\\u2026 We\\u2019re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, \\u201cOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh, we can just swing back and get it.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like\\u2026 she\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be fine \\u2019cause it\\u2019s St. Patrick\\u2019s day, and there\\u2019s bouncers.\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019ll be okay.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo, it won\\u2019t be okay.\\u201d And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they\\u2019re like birthday clowns like, you know, \\u201cWhat can I do to make your day better?\\u201d\\nYou know, and that\\u2019s\\u2026 We\\u2019re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn\\u2019t the idea. And so I said\\u2026 I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh\\u2026 But she warmed to me as the night went on \\u2019cause she was drinking, and then, like\\u2026 No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we\\u2026 I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and\\u2026 We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, \\u201cSure.\\u201d We get to her door, and I didn\\u2019t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, \\u201cOh, no, thank you.\\u201d Which I thought was polite\\u2026 But disappointing. I mean, there\\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\\u2019re really putting yourself out there. You\\u2019re just like, \\u201cI think we should connect mouths,\\u201d you know, and\\u2026 The other person\\u2019s like, \\u201cI do not think we should connect mouths.\\u201d And those are\\u2026 They\\u2019re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You\\u2019re like, \\u201cI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.\\u201d This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I\\u2026 I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember\\u2026 I remember it like it was yesterday \\u2019cause I was shocked. I was like, \\u201cPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?\\u201d \\u201cBut how?\\u201d You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, \\u201cI am not doing that.\\u201d And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, \\u201cThat is fine. \\u201cYou are not on the list. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cPerfect.\\u201d It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.\\u201d And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It\\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That\\u2019s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that\\u2019s right? Okay, good. So\\u2026 In seventh grade, I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody.\\u201d And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, \\u201cwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. \\u201cFirst order of business, Nintendo. \\u201cSecond order of business, why doesn\\u2019t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared\\u2026 I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, \\u201cI got to try to get into the make-out club.\\u201d But it was a very intangible goal. I didn\\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls, and\\u2026 There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had\\u2026 I don\\u2019t\\u2026 The rest of the show is in old English. Uh\\u2026 She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, \\u201cOh, this is great. I got to do that more.\\u201d And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well \\u2019cause she goes, \\u201cMike, you got to stop. I\\u2019m gonna pee myself.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d This was the closest I\\u2019d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that\\u2019s how I ended up here. Yeah. That\\u2019s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So\\u2026 uh\\u2026 So here\\u2019s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn\\u2019t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, \\u201cWell, maybe this will be like \\u201cone of those romantic comedy montages. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll go to the carnival, we\\u2019ll get stuck \\u201cOn the top of the Ferris wheel, we\\u2019ll make out. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.\\u201d But I think that when you\\u2019re 12 years old, you just don\\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don\\u2019t know that you shouldn\\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It\\u2019s basically saying, \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna take sugar, \\u201cwhich everyone knows is bad, but then we\\u2019ll dress it up like insulation.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure \\u201cwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe already sold it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the \\u201cshits of pants-erator,\\u201d and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said\\u2026 They said, \\u201cWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy says, \\u201cWell, what about the \\u2018I think I\\u2019m gonna die-erator\\u2019?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good, \\u201c\\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \\u201cwhen you\\u2019re on the machine. \\u201cPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, \\u201cwhich is a nice homage \\u201cto the original intention of the machine, \\u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.\\u201d And then one guy goes, \\u201cwell, what about the scrambler? \\u2018Cause it scrambles you!\\u201d They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe get it, Frank, but who\\u2026\\u201d Frank is a maniac. This guy can\\u2019t be stopped, but every once in a while, he\\u2019s got a good idea. \\u201cBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?\\u201d And this one guy goes, \\u201cwell, I have a nephew who\\u2019s 16 years old \\u201cand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201che sounds amazing. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.\\u201d\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I\\u2019m feeling good. Like, she\\u2019s snuggling up close to me, and I\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 I\\u2019m thinking like, \\u201cthis could be it. \\u201cThis could be where it\\u2019s all gonna happen. This is very special.\\u201d And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It\\u2019s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s saved lives. I think the only thing it\\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it\\u2019s just sort of held someone\\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don\\u2019t talk about scrambler accident. That\\u2019s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, \\u201chey, actually\\u2026\\u201d And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn\\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I\\u2019m scrambling, and\\u2026 As I am scrambling, I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cI need to come up with a plan of some kind. I\\u2019m not going down without a fight.\\u201d My first plan was very simple. It was just don\\u2019t look at Lisa, don\\u2019t look at any other people. I was like, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at Lisa, \\u201cdon\\u2019t look at any other people. I need a new plan.\\u201d And\\u2026 The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator\\u2026 That he needed to stop the ride, but\\u2026 The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. \\u201cI got to tell him he\\u2019s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!\\u201d And I\\u2019m back! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he heard me. \\u201cI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure he\\u2019s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.\\u201d The third time I said, \\u201cplease stop.\\u201d And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just\\u2026 Popcorn, peanuts\\u2026 Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I\\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um\\u2026 I\\u2019m at the St. John\\u2019s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John\\u2019s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So\\u2026 Cattle shows up at 8:00. We\\u2019ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that \\u2019cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss \\u2019cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, \\u201coh, have you had your first kiss?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, like, all the time. Like, every\\u2026 every week.\\u201d I always feared at some point there\\u2019d be a follow-up question like, \\u201coh, yeah? What\\u2019s it like?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, you know, it\\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone.\\u201d And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno, it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop.\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.\\u201d I\\u2019m at the dance, and I\\u2019m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we\\u2019re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And we were like, \\u201cmoo!\\u201d And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we\\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d Which I know it\\u2019s the worst turn of phrase, but I\\u2019m comfortable saying it \\u2019cause I know I\\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then her friend goes like, \\u201coof.\\u201d You know, or even worse\\u2026 or even worse, like, \\u201cyou owe me,\\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone\\u2019s credit score, you know. So he goes\\u2026 he goes, \\u201cyou get that one.\\u201d And then I\\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc\\u2019s bust a move. And I\\u2019m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it\\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\\u2026 Hey! So she\\u2019s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I\\u2019m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What\\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\\u2019t really mess it up \\u2019cause it\\u2019s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t pick up on social cues,\\u201d you know. But it\\u2019s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I\\u2019m just trying not to fidget. I\\u2019m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn\\u2019t know anything about making out, but I\\u2019d seen people do it. I could see there\\u2019s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no\\u2026 You know, there\\u2019s no video documentation of that area. It\\u2019s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They\\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\\u2026 Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but\\u2026 So I\\u2019m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo\\u2026 All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, \\u201coh, no. I don\\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\\u201d And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it\\u2019s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery \\u2019cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, \\u201cI\\u2019m not alone anymore! I\\u2019m not in the non-make-out club!\\u201d And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn\\u2019t because up until that point, I\\u2019d lied and said that I\\u2019d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, \\u201chow\\u2019d it go, dude?\\u201d I had to be like, \\u201csame as always. Pretty smooth.\\u201d As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, \\u201cwell, maybe it did go well, \\u201cand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,\\u201d but\\u2026 I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn\\u2019t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, \\u201chey, you like full house? \\u201cMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.\\u201d You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, \\u201cwhy are you calling me?\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201coh, I\\u2019m probably reading into that one too much,\\u201d and\\u2026 And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, \\u201coh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.\\u201d But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn\\u2019t even tell my friends, until one day I was\\u2026 I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn\\u2019t called me back.\\u201d And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom was like, \\u201cnothing.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d Tom\\u2019s like, \\u201coh.\\u201d \\u201cI talked to Sandra, and she said \\u201cyou\\u2019re the worst kisser she\\u2019s ever kissed.\\u201d And it was so devastating \\u2019cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn\\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn\\u2019t say, \\u201cthat makes sense. I\\u2019ve never done that before.\\u201d So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, \\u201cyeah, that sounds about right. \\u201cI\\u2019m a terrible kisser. That\\u2019s kind of my thing.\\u201d So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, \\u201coh, no, thank you.\\u201d She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn\\u2019t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We\\u2019re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, \\u201ceveryone hates me at work,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cwhy would they hate you? I love you.\\u201d She goes, \\u201cyou love me?\\u201d I go, \\u201cI mean, you seem cool.\\u201d I pulled it back. I didn\\u2019t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, \\u201cyou know, sometimes I\\u2019ll date two people at once, and that way I\\u2019m never let down by either person.\\u201d I said, \\u201cthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, I\\u2019d like to do that as well.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you\\u2019re seeing them.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201call right, sounds like a plan. \\u201cGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.\\u201d And so a few nights later, I\\u2019m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I\\u2019m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, \\u201chow was your trip?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cit was great. I did some shows, \\u201cand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.\\u201d And that didn\\u2019t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m right about that, right? Like, I\\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyeah, but it doesn\\u2019t mean \\u201cthat I won\\u2019t lose interest in you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a whole new clause! \\u201cThat\\u2019s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?\\u201d I said, \\u201care you still seeing John?\\u201d And she said, \\u201csometimes.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwell, don\\u2019t you see the contradiction in that?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cyes.\\u201d And it gets very quiet\\u2026 Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn\\u2019t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda \\u2019cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it\\u2019s winter in New York, it is also winter\\u2026 In Bermuda, and, uh\\u2026 Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she\\u2019s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I\\u2019m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And\\u2026 and Jenny\\u2019s late. And then we get to security, and I\\u2019m not making this up, she doesn\\u2019t have a license or a passport. And I said, \\u201cwhat do you mean?\\u201d I go, \\u201chow do you travel?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cwell, \\u201cusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.\\u201d I don\\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can\\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what\\u2026 what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they\\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn\\u2019t want that, unless they\\u2019re lesbians, although there\\u2019s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda\\u2026 Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although\\u2026 then they\\u2019d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know I was a lesbian \\u201cuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. \\u201cAnd now that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m into. \\u201cI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, \\u201cthey\\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \\u201cand 71 of my friends. But now I don\\u2019t see Khalid in the same way anymore.\\u201d The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we\\u2019re on the flight\\u2026 On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, \\u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon.\\u201d And we said, \\u201coh, no, thanks. We\\u2019re not on our honeymoon.\\u201d And she walks away, and Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s so funny. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cyeah. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d ever want to get married in my life.\\u201d And I said, \\u201coh, really?\\u201d I go, \\u201cme too.\\u201d I said, \\u201cis that based on a principle, \\u201cor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?\\u201d And\\u2026 She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was\\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they\\u2026 you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, \\u201cthen what?\\u201d And she said, \\u201che died. He had leukemia.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cno, I don\\u2019t really like to talk about it.\\u201d But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we\\u2019d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we\\u2026 At one point, I was like, \\u201cwell, we should do this again. \\u201cWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.\\u201d Jenny said, \\u201cthat sounds great, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d get a license or a passport \\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but it\\u2019s the law.\\u201d You know. Jenny says, \\u201cyeah, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll get one \\u201c\\u2019cause they don\\u2019t make me get one, you know. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d That\\u2019s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she\\u2019ll just say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not an argument.\\u201d \\u201cLike, we\\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\\u2019t have an argument.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cthat\\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.\\u201d And she\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just won that argument,\\u201d again. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh\\u2026 On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, \\u201cwe should play.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cyeah, but not, like, a game.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, \\u2019cause I\\u2019d win.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cno, I think I would win.\\u201d I go, \\u201cno. I know that I\\u2019d win, \\u201cand I know that what I\\u2019m supposed to say is that\\u2026 \\u201cThe guy says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 the girl says, \\u2018I\\u2019ll win,\\u2019 \\u201cand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don\\u2019t have that in me.\\u201d And Jenny goes, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t have to let me win. Let\\u2019s go out and play.\\u201d And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like\\u2026 It was just like\\u2026 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never met someone who\\u2019s so obsessed with the score.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthe score is what makes it a game!\\u201d So we\\u2019re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we\\u2019re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why you\\u2019re so obsessed with being right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI\\u2019m not obsessed with it. I just am.\\u201d I said, \\u201cwhy do you think you\\u2019re right?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d I said, \\u201cif you think I\\u2019m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\u201d Which is true, but it doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you\\u2019re just like, \\u201cthis is it. I found her. I\\u2019m 17 years old, and I\\u2019m done, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, \\u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\\u2019t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.\\u201d And I was just like, \\u201cawesome.\\u201d Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just\\u2026 I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, \\u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cgood answer.\\u201d\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cno one likes you at all. Only kidding.\\u201d Or, like, \\u201cyou\\u2019re like a nerd, but you\\u2019re not even smart. Just joking.\\u201d Can\\u2019t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don\\u2019t\\u2026 I don\\u2019t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a\\u2026 It\\u2019s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You\\u2019d know when he was lying \\u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he\\u2019d go, \\u201cyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.\\u201d And he wasn\\u2019t even handling money. Like, I don\\u2019t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyeah, my uncle\\u2019s Tony Robbins, \\u201cmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.\\u201d And\\u2026 We found out that that wasn\\u2019t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn\\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that\\u2019s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you\\u2019re lying about big stuff. It\\u2019s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I\\u2019m in the future also. I think we can all see now \\u2019cause we\\u2019re so smart, and Mike\\u2019s so dumb, and, uh\\u2026 You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that\\u2019s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time \\u2019cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, \\u201cwell, this is the affirmation that I need. I\\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.\\u201d And I drive my mom\\u2019s station wagon to Amanda\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house, and I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Amanda, and there\\u2019s her parents, and it\\u2019s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I\\u2019m assuming he\\u2019s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I\\u2019m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They\\u2019re both in their first year in college, and they\\u2019re competitive wrestlers, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s dawning on me that I\\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend. And it\\u2019s going pretty well. I mean, he\\u2026 He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, \\u201cI wish it were just you and me here.\\u201d And I remember thinking, \\u201cyou could make that happen.\\u201d The way she said it was as though she weren\\u2019t involved in the decision process, like, \\u201cI\\u2019d love to, but the boys in corporate\\u2026\\u201d\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you\\u2019re like\\u2026 \\u201cMaybe if this goes well, she\\u2019ll see that I\\u2019m good with adults in general!\\u201d As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, \\u201chow do you know Amanda?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwe\\u2019re just friends from school.\\u201d And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, \\u201cI am never gonna let this happen to me again.\\u201d So\\u2026 Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize \\u2019cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful \\u2019cause it was\\u2026 In Texas. And I\\u2026 that\\u2019s\\u2026 That\\u2019s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It\\u2019s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh\\u2026 But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is\\u2026 which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy\\u2026 I love comedy clubs \\u2019cause they\\u2019re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they\\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there\\u2019s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they\\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s actually a thing. I didn\\u2019t even realize that\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if\\u2026 And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I\\u2026 but that\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s not my job. I\\u2019m\\u2026 you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just\\u2026 I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And\\u2026 I\\u2019d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, \\u201cwhatever I can do to help. I don\\u2019t see how this could end badly.\\u201d And, uh\\u2026 The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I\\u2019m hung over, and I\\u2019m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I\\u2019m still two hours early, and\\u2026 I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny\\u2019s parents\\u2019 house. And I walk in the front door, and there\\u2019s Jenny, and there\\u2019s her parents. And there\\u2019s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn\\u2019t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, \\u201cwell, what\\u2019s John doing here?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, he and I aren\\u2019t still together, \\u201cbut when we were together, \\u201che became friends with my stepdad, \\u201cand he\\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cyou know, that\\u2019s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.\\u201d Jenny\\u2019s staring at me. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d She says, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s true.\\u201d And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwhere is that from?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.\\u201d That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there\\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and\\u2026 We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn\\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I was like, \\u201cwell, what about John? What was he doing there?\\u201d She said, \\u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\\u201d I said, \\u201cyeah, but at least I told you the truth.\\u201d And she said, \\u201ceventually.\\u201d And I said, \\u201ceventually is better than never!\\u201d And then she kneed me in the balls. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever experienced this before. I\\u2019m sure half of you have not. Uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s like being electrocuted, except you don\\u2019t get to die. It\\u2019s like you want to die, but you can\\u2019t. And there\\u2019s a person in your face saying, \\u201cyou deserve this,\\u201d which they wouldn\\u2019t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\u00a0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, \\u201cI think that we should just break up. \\u201cYou know, it\\u2019s not just this. \\u201cI mean, you\\u2019re away a lot of the time. \\u201cAnd even when you\\u2019re here, you work at night, \\u201cand I work in the day. I just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cokay.\\u201d\\u00a0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her \\u2019cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I\\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \\u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\\u201d And it would just say, \\u201chi.\\u201d And I\\u2019d write back, \\u201chi.\\u201d It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year\\u2019s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, \\u201chey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.\\u201d And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, \\u201cwhat?\\u201d And she says, \\u201cI think that we should live together.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, I really don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a good idea. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019ve just decided, you know, as a principle, \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone. It\\u2019s not personal.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cwell, unless we live together, \\u201cI just don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna work out \\u201c\\u2019cause we just don\\u2019t see each other enough, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t think that we stand a chance. That\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, \\u201coh, no, thanks.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t go over so well. She says, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, as you know, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in marriage, and so I don\\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, what do you believe in?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d She said, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, first of all, \\u201cyou know, it just doesn\\u2019t seem necessary. \\u201cI mean, is it\\u2026 you know, \\u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \\u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a part of that. \\u201cSecond of all, I don\\u2019t even think we have \\u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. \\u201cI mean, one of me and Andy\\u2019s friends \\u201cwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, \\u201cand we said, \\u2018are you sure this is the person \\u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life?\\u2019 \\u201cand he goes, \\u2018yeah, I think so.\\u2019 \\u201cand we said, \\u2018well, what if she gets in a car accident, \\u201cand she\\u2019s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?\\u2019 \\u201cand he said, \\u2018maybe\\u2019! \\u201cThat is not an acceptable answer! \\u201cThird of all, if I\\u2019m so in love, \\u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not one of these like, \\u201c\\u2018I don\\u2019t want government up in my business\\u2019 kind of people! \\u201cI think the government does a nice job \\u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting I don\\u2019t eat poison, \\u201cbut I just don\\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \\u201cin my personal relationships. \\u201cThen finally, if marriage is religious, \\u201cshouldn\\u2019t I believe in the religion? \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \\u201cwhere the people on the altar don\\u2019t believe \\u201cin the religion of the church they\\u2019ve invited us to! \\u201cSome of them even go to classes with the priest \\u201cin advance, to more elaborately lie \\u201cabout believing in a religion they don\\u2019t believe in \\u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! \\u201cThat is insane! That\\u2019s how I feel!\\u201d So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, \\u201cwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwhy? Aren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d And Jenny says, \\u201cthat\\u2019s how I feel.\\u201d At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we\\u2019d been arguing all night, and we hadn\\u2019t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I\\u2019m overtired, and I\\u2019m angry, and I\\u2019m late. I\\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It\\u2019s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn\\u2019t even there. There\\u2019s a guy with a laptop going, \\u201cwe need a road, stat! What\\u2019s the code for building, tank?\\u201d You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn\\u2019t even started yet. It\\u2019s just an anchor looking around like, \\u201cwhat are you up to?\\u201d And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, \\u201cwell, that ain\\u2019t your gate.\\u201d Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, \\u201cI was not involved in this process. I wasn\\u2019t even C.C.\\u2019d.\\u201d Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, \\u201cB22. Like hell I\\u2019m flying out of B22.\\u201d And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, \\u201cthis is where I\\u2019m going.\\u201d You know, I\\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, \\u201cwell, where is this gate?\\u201d She goes, \\u201cit\\u2019s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.\\u201d She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, \\u201cand you better run.\\u201d Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run. I have wheels.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. \\u201cI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I\\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours.\\u201d Then I\\u2026 I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, \\u201cperfect. That\\u2019s exactly how long I want to wait.\\u201d But the tram\\u2019s riding away. I was like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s -1 minute!\\u201d Then it says ten minutes, and I\\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, \\u201coh, great, I\\u2019m gonna miss my flight, \\u201cand then I\\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on, \\u201cand I\\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion. \\u201cAnd then I\\u2019m not gonna have a family, and then I\\u2019m gonna be a crack whore.\\u201d And it\\u2019s like, all of a sudden, I\\u2019m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\\u2026\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I\\u2019m sweaty, and I\\u2019m out of breath, but I\\u2019m on time. And I\\u2019m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I\\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I\\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that\\u2019s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, \\u201cdo you know these people?\\u201d She was like, \\u201call I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.\\u201d I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, \\u201cDrew Barrymore\\u2019s character, come back!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I\\u2019d missed my show. I\\u2019d never missed one of my shows before, and I\\u2019m so angry. And Jenny\\u2019s calling me, but I\\u2019m not picking up the phone \\u2019cause I\\u2019m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy\\u2019s house, and I said, \\u201cAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!\\u201d And Andy goes, \\u201cyou\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know! I\\u2019m right!\\u201d He goes, \\u201cyeah, you\\u2019re right.\\u201d I go, \\u201cI know, I\\u2019m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!\\u201d I drive out of Andy\\u2019s small road, and I\\u2019m t-boned. That\\u2019s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I\\u2019m spun around, and I think I\\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I\\u2019m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri\\u2026 have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that\\u2019s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn\\u2019t\\u2026 Doesn\\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it\\u2019s like, \\u201coh, I guess I should be doing something \\u201cthat matches that. Waah!\\u201d I\\u2019m crying because I\\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don\\u2019t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I\\u2019d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and\\u2026 The officer comes over, and he says, \\u201cwhat happened?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI got hit by this car, \\u201cand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.\\u201d The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can\\u2019t help but think, \\u201cthat\\u2019s karma. That\\u2019s a hit and run and hit.\\u201d And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, \\u201csign this.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, what does it mean?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cit means you\\u2019re okay and that we can leave.\\u201d I was really shaken up. I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cjust sign it,\\u201d which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you\\u2019ve just said no to, and it\\u2019s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours \\u2019cause the other driver had beat us there, and\\u2026 Eventually, we\\u2019re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, \\u201cwell, was the other guy drunk?\\u201d And the doctor says, \\u201cwell, I can\\u2019t answer that.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cwas he?\\u201d He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, \\u201cwell, he\\u2019s heading to jail now.\\u201d And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, \\u201ccase closed.\\u201d A few hours later, we\\u2019re back at Andy\\u2019s house, it\\u2019s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, \\u201cI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.\\u201d And Andy says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.\\u201d And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 Sleep on it.\\u201d He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed\\u2026 And I\\u2019m not making this up\\u2026 $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver\\u2019s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, \\u201cwell, this can\\u2019t be happening.\\u201d I explained to the woman, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a misunderstanding. \\u201cThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.\\u201d So I requested the accident report, and I\\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\\u2026 But it\\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1\\u2026 that\\u2019s me\\u2026 started to go, but all of a sudden V-1\\u2026 That\\u2019s me also\\u2026 Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I\\u2019m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver\\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was, \\u201cI was on Venice going\\u2026 uh, I\\u2019m not too sure. \\u201cI was going away from the beach. \\u201cI was driving. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what happened. \\u201cDid I hurt anyone? \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where I was going, \\u201cbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.\\u201d Which is really everyone\\u2019s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That\\u2019s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it\\u2019s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.\\u201d The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know \\u2019cause I\\u2019m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I\\u2019m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I\\u2019m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d I know, and, I mean, that\\u2019s what I said. I go, \\u201caren\\u2019t you listening to any of this?\\u201d I go, \\u201cand this guy was clearly drunk. \\u201cI mean, he nearly killed me. \\u201cInches from where he hit, \\u201cand I would be dead right now. \\u201cAnd he wants me to pay for his car? \\u201cDon\\u2019t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?\\u201d And he says, \\u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\\u2019s car.\\u201d And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it\\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I\\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There\\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d and he says, \\u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno. This isn\\u2019t about money.\\u201d And he doesn\\u2019t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI\\u2019m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy\\u2019s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, \\u201cJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, \\u201cbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I\\u2019m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!\\u201d At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, \\u201chey, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s going on!\\u201d I\\u2019d tell them this whole story. And they\\u2019d be like, \\u201cyou should get a lawyer.\\u201d I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn\\u2019t even touch this!\\u201d \\u2018Cause he wouldn\\u2019t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she\\u2019s talking to me, but I\\u2019m not listening \\u2019cause I\\u2019m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I\\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I\\u2019m gonna call that week. And I\\u2019m so angry, I\\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I\\u2019m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, \\u201cwhat are you doing?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, this is my case.\\u201d And she says, \\u201cwell, why don\\u2019t you work on that in the morning?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, which part of this napkin don\\u2019t you understand?\\u201d Jenny says, \\u201cMike\\u2026 \\u201cYou\\u2019re right, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s only hurting you, \\u201cand I\\u2019m just so glad that you\\u2019re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.\\u201d She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy\\u2019s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn\\u2019t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don\\u2019t. But I believe in her, and I\\u2019ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much! Thanks for coming here tonight and joining me.\",\n          \"Intro\\nFade the music out. Let\\u2019s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all. \\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom! \\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d \\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah. \\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was. \\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d \\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. \\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go. \\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared. \\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d \\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d \\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there. \\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d \\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad. \\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d \\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending. \\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man. \\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought. \\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit. Thanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.\",\n          \"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d \\u266a A whole new world \\u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d I\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d I can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.
